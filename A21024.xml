            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was an ancient constitution in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, that a brother dying without issue, the next brother should doe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a kinseman, and raise vp seede to his brother deceased, to continue his name that it might not bee put out of Israell. The Lord hauing not long since taken out of his vineyard a faithfull labourer, &amp; from my selfe a louing, and deare brother, I thought that in some manner the equity of this constitution, now antiquated and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, did lay hold vpon me. And that beeing the next brother, I was to do the office of a brother, to continue, and eternize his blessed memoriall in Gods Church by bringing to light this present treatise. He himselfe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest hee liued wrote it, and had perfected it before his
<pb facs="tcp:19272:3"/> death, I haue but onely raised it out of his priuate studie to the publique vse of Gods Church. <hi>The children,</hi> saide Hezekiah, <hi>are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.</hi> Thus it fared with this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. 3.</note> Hee had finished and perfected this worke, and brought it euen to the birth, but there was no time to bring it foorth. God preuenting him, and, by his death, bringing him to the end of his faith, (his translation into the heauens) before he came to bring this work to the end of his desire, (the publication therof to the benefit of Gods Church:) I thought it great pitty that so hopefull an issue should perish for want of a little helpe in the birth. And I thought withall in case of my negligence, or refusall of his brotherly office, how iustly I might haue deserued the ignominious ceremony of the spittle in my face. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I willingly performed this taske of perusing and <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thus in briefe hath your Ladiship, the reason of my <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.</note> present endeauours.</p>
            <p>For me to say any thing in commendation of this work is not happely so fitting. It beeing both hard for one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to commend another without boasting, and the younger and inferiour his commendation adding little credit or grace to the worke of his elder and superiour. For <hi>as the lesse is blessed,</hi> so also praysed of the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 7.</note> I meane therefore heerein to bee sparing. Onelie this; I will but as the widdows, which shewed <hi>Peter</hi> the coates and garments which <hi>Dorcas made, while shee</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19272:3"/>
               <hi>was with them.</hi> So onely will I shew, and set forth some part of his labours which hee performed whilest hee was with vs. <hi>And let his owne workes praise him in the gate.</hi> And surely this worke will doe it, if either matter, <note place="margin">

            <p>The matter and argument of it is such, as yet handled at large by none before him that I know of.</p>
            <p>And besides it is excellent by reason of the daily vse which occurres in practise. So that of the title and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this booke may I say as <hi>Gellius</hi> speakes of a good title which <hi>Melissus</hi> had giuen to a book of his own which it seemed scarse deserued it, <hi>That the very title</hi>

               <hi>had a great alluring &amp; entising force to draw men to the reading of it.</hi> Such is the argument of this worke, of such speciall vse in our practise, that it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perswade any, both to read, and like it. It containes the right <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the art of knowing a mans selfe; it discouers vnto vs, the infinitely intricate windings, &amp; turnings of the darke Labyrinths of mans heart. Indeed oftentimes the discoueries of cousenages, and deceits in the worlde make many, before honestly ignorant, to turn <hi>couseners and deceiuers.</hi> But heere needes no such feare, for heere we are taught no new <hi>deceit</hi> or <hi>couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning trickes,</hi> which yet wee practise not; but rather are conuinced of that cousenage, with which we deceiue our owne soules, and yet will not be borne downe to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of imposture. This point is worthy our best wits, and knowledge. That heathen Philosopher neuer thought himselfe to begin to know Philosophy, till he began to know himselfe. But surely wee neuer beginne to know <hi>Diuinitie</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> till wee come to know our selues: our selues wee cannot know, till wee know our
<pb facs="tcp:19272:4"/> hearts. I but, our hearts are deceitfull aboue all things, who can know them? They who with diligence shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s present treatise shall with Gods blessing be able in some good measure to know them. Here shall they find that dangerous Art of <hi>selfe-Sophistry</hi> displayed, by which millions of soules are enwrapped in the snares of Satan. And so by seeing their selfe-deceit, shall come to their selfe-knowledge. A knowledge neuer more negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>Vt nemo in sese tentat descendere, nemo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pers.</note> Men care not for knowing themselues, who are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too too curiously greedy of knowing all things else, being heerein like to foolish trauellers, that loue to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell into, and talk of other strange countries, strangers in the meane time in the rarities, secrets, and wonders of their owne. As for the Art, and manner of handling this argument in this treatise, I leaue it to the readers iudgement, aduenturing notwithstanding my selfe to say thus much, that had this treatise but age and antiquitie answerable to the sufficiency, it should easily find answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance. Nothing preiudices writers more, then either mens knowledge of their persons, or their want of antiquity. May not a man speake of many of our new wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as <hi>Gellius</hi> spake once of a good speech that <hi>Fauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> made? <hi>Nonne,</hi> saith he, <hi>si id Antisthenes, aut Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes dixisset, dignum memoria visum esset?</hi> If <hi>Diogenes</hi> or <hi>Antisthenes</hi> had but spoken that which <note place="margin">Noct. Attic. 18 7.</note>
               <hi>Fauorinus</hi> did, the speech had gone for halfe an oracle, now happily the more respectles because from <hi>Fauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that was inferior, it may be, in nothing to <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> but in standing. How many worthy moderne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters amongst vs neglected, onely because moderne? <hi>Nonne si haec Augustinus, aut Chrisostomus, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19272:4"/> Had but <hi>Augustine,</hi> or <hi>Chrysostome</hi> or some auncient Father wrote them, how had they beene admired, now neglected, onely because as <hi>Bildad</hi> speakes <hi>they are but of yesterday?</hi> Most mens iudgement of writers is the <note place="margin">Iob. 8. 9.</note> same that of wine. Luk. 5. 39. <hi>The olde is better.</hi> And yet oftentimes, the old is hard and tart, and neerer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger then wine, when the new is sweet and pleasant. How many workes of some of the Fathers which haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth else in them besides antiquity, and the credit of an ancient Fathers name? How would we vilifie those same things in new; which wee so magnifie in olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? I speake it not to derogate ought from the worth of those ancient worthies, and reuerend sages, (I giue them all due reuerenc and respect) but only to meet with that fond humour, which measures worth onely by age, as if nothing could be good, but that which is olde: And from a meane conceit of writers persons knowne, are ready to preiudge their workes vnread, and vnknowne.</p>
            <p>But as for your Ladiship; I perswade my selfe that your knowledge of the Authors person, parts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments wherewithall God had graced him, will be the greater meanes to winne your Honourable acceptance of this worke. And so much the rather do I presume vpon your Ladiships fauour heerein, because whilest this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor liued (out of a loue to his graces, and honourable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) he entended this worke to haue bene honoured by the Patronage of your woorthy and right noble bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, who now also together with this Author is at rest, singing heauenly <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> in the presence of the Lambe.</p>
            <p>Pardon me good Madam, if I renew your griefe with the mention and remembrance of so great a losse. Giue
<pb facs="tcp:19272:5"/> vs leaue to testifie our fellow feeling of your sorrowes. Publick losses may not passe without publicke heauines. It is a losse that yeelds vs argument both of great griefe, &amp; as great fear: Can it be a small griefe to see our selues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the vse &amp; benefit of so many rare vertues, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable inclinations, of so great learning in so few years, of so great grace, holines, and religion in so young yeares, as were sweetly met &amp; combined in him? His rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, his noble disposition, his religious conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his hopefull seruice to Gods Church, and this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom considered, I may say of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as once <hi>Valerius</hi> spake of <hi>Cornelia</hi> in the losse of her louing husband, <hi>Corneliam nescio an faeliciorem dixerim quod talem virum habuerit, an miseriorem</hi>

                  <hi>Is.</hi> 57. 1.</note> no man considereth that he is taken away, from the euill that is to come. Surely when good men, especially being great men, &amp; young men too, are taken away, it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full presage of much anger, and euill to come. The Lord make vs all wise to <hi>consider</hi> the deaths of such men, that the feare of euills to come, may make vs seeke to auoide euill present, and make vs prudent in the foresight of the plagues to hide our selues.</p>
            <p>But yet in the middest of this greefe and feare, your Ladiship is not left altogether comfortles. As it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that God honoured your familie with such an one, so is this also none of the least comforts to you, that you
<pb facs="tcp:19272:5"/> mourne not alone, but haue the hearts of all good men heauy with yours. It makes our ioy the greater to haue others reioyce with vs, when wee reioyce: but it makes our sorrow the lesse when we haue others, to weepe with <note place="margin">2, <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 33.</note> vs, when we weepe. <hi>Did Abner,</hi> said <hi>Dauid, dye as a foole?</hi> So of him it may be said. Did he dye as an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting, as an ignoble person? without teares? without lamentation? I thinke I may boldly speake it, that neuer any of his place, and of his yeares, left more heauy hearts behinde him then hee hath done. These are miserable griefes indeede, when others find matter of ioy in the matter of our griefe, and laugh at our teares; but then may we grieue comfortably, when we see others ioyne with vs, and lay to heart our losses, as well as our selues.</p>
            <p>I would willingly both inlarge his commendation and our griefe, but these require rather a Volume then an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle. And I may speake of him as <hi>Augustine</hi> of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Illa quidem anima in societatem fidelium et</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </gap>n a lamentation for his death.</p>
            <p>Yet may I not altogether passe ouer in silence his holie and religious course; which was, to keepe a catalogue or diary of his sinnes against God: and euery night, or the next morning, to reuiew the faults of the day past: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Saboth morning, or night before, to reuiew the faults of the whole weeke: and at the ende of euery moneth to suruay the whole moneths transgressions. This did hee daily, weekely, and monthly, thereby the better to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:19272:6"/> himselfe for his sinnes, and renew his practise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And the day before his receiuing of the holie Sacrament did alwaies vse to humble himselfe before the Lord with fasting, prayer, and confession, thereby the better to prepare himselfe for the more worthy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable receiuing of the holy communion.</p>
            <p>I say nothing of his religious obseruation of the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth by himselfe alone, &amp; with his people about him both before and after the publicke exercises, in meditation, reading, prayer, and repetitions. His carefull expense of time, his keeping of set houres of study. Thus did he with good <hi>Iosiah, while he was yet a child seeke the Lord.</hi> By means of which his holy &amp; constant course in seeking the Lord, in fewe yeares he became wiser then his aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and teachers, and preserued his young yeares, in great honour and reputation, free from all the blemishes and stayns of youth, notwithstanding the manifold occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to the contrary in regard of his place &amp; condition. The truth is, the world was not worthy of him. His ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and his graces were fitter for heauen, then this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure earth.</p>
            <p>Let vs now that are behinde, turne our <hi>griefe</hi> into <hi>care,</hi> let our care bee to follow those holy steps hee hath trod before vs. True it is you can neuer recouer his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, his graces you may: The greefe will bee the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sse for the losse of his person, if you make a recouery of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Whilest his spirit is doubled vpon your Honour, and his graces shall suruiue in your religious imitation, so long we shall count him liuing in your selfe.</p>
            <p>And now Right honourable I intreat you by the loue that he bare to this Author, &amp; by the loue that you bare to his honourable Patrones, your deceased Father, and

                  <p>The Text opened; A preparation to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following, shewing the originall of the hearts deceitfulnesse, the difficultie, and yet the meanes of knowing it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE prophet hauing grieuously <note place="margin">Coher.</note> menaced the Iewes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw, how much they bore themselues out against these threatnings, vpon hope of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> his helpe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Psal. 3 4.</note> in the fifth verse hee curseth all such, as rely vpon man, and <hi>make flesh their arme,</hi> contrarily bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such, as in their dangers shroud and shelter themselues vnder the <hi>wing</hi> of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>But heere the Iewes hauing <hi>made a couenant with hell and death,</hi> would be ready to obiect against the prophet; what then is all this threatning to vs?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19272:10"/> Wee are none of those that withdraw their hearts from God. Vse of meanes doth not preiudice trust in God. Trust in God as it cannot stand with <hi>trust in</hi> meanes; so neither without <hi>vse of</hi> meanes when they may be had. Wee repose our selues on God as much as thy selfe, or any else: and we repaire to the second causes, only as seruiceable, and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the first. Therefore <hi>as the sparrow by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and the swallow by fleeing escape,</hi> so this thy <hi>causelesse curse shall not come:</hi> neither are we such chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be skarred with bugs-words.</p>
               <p>The prophet therefore in this verse preuenteth this obiection, and keepeth them from this starting hole, saying, <hi>The heart is deceitfull,</hi> as if he should say: Flatter not your selues in a vaine conceit, that you with-drawe not your heart from God, and so God will not with-drawe his from you. Nothing more easy than for a man to deceiue himselfe: for the heart by reason of the great wickednesse thereof, is a bottom-lesse and vnsearchable gulfe of guile; in so much as none can know, not only anothers, but not his owne heart, The Lord only hath reserued this as a prerogatiue royall to himselfe, exactly to know the depth of our hearts: that so, though men conceiuing well of themselues, may conceiue amisse of God, as one that by his doings will not iustifie the prophets sayings; yet hee iudging of men according to the secret disposition and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their hearts, may deale with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, blessing those that in truth do trust in him, but cursing such as with-drawe from him, though not their tongues, yet their hearts. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19272:10"/> and generall purpose of the wordes.</p>
               <p>They containe in them a proposition concerning <note place="margin">Resolution and sence.</note> the hearts deceitfulnesse. Heere two things are to be considered: what is meant by <hi>heart,</hi> what by <hi>deceitfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>heart,</hi> mans heart is meant, as appeareth by the context. And now because mans heart is one of the principall seats of the soule of man, therefore by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>subiect,</hi> it is vsually in the Scripture put sometimes for the whole soule, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (and that more frequently) for such speciall faculties in the soule, as more specially belong to the heart, as the will and affections. But heere it is to bee taken for the whole soule and all the parts thereof, the vnderstanding, the will, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for all are deceitfull.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>deceitfull</hi> is significant in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gnacob.</note> comming of a verbe which signifieth to supplant, as runners in the race vse to do; and from this word had <hi>Iakob</hi> his name, because he caught <hi>Esau</hi> by the heele when he was comming forth of the wombe: So doe our hearts cunningly, as it were, trip our <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 36.</note> heele, when wee are to runne the race which is set before vs. Though heere also that reason of the name which <hi>Esau</hi> falsely gaue to <hi>Iakob,</hi> may truely agree to our hearts, well may they be called <hi>Iakobs,</hi> because they cozen many, and doe their indeuour to cozen all of Gods blessing and the heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. But it may be asked, Is this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse giuen vnto all men indifferently, or only to some? <hi>Answ.</hi> To all, saue <hi>Christ, in whose mouth</hi> (and so heart) <hi>was found no guile.</hi> By nature all our hearts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19272:11"/> are a like, And the change that grace makes in this life is not such, but that in some sort, the heart of the best may still be said to be deceitfull. Christ indeed giues <hi>Nathanael</hi> this praise, that there was no guile in his heart, and <hi>Dauid</hi> saies the like of euery iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Psal. 32 2.</note> man: but this is true only of the <hi>spirit,</hi> of the <hi>new,</hi> or <hi>young man</hi> that is created by God in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and not of the <hi>flesh,</hi> that <hi>olde man,</hi> an olde foxe indeed, that by reason of his age is often too hard for the yong man: for youth is but simple in regard of old age; Howbeit as yong men grow still to further perfection, and are on the increasing hand, whereas old men decrease, till at length <hi>age</hi> brings <hi>dotage:</hi> so heere the <hi>craft</hi> of this <hi>old man</hi> is daily weakened, the rather for those many wounds which the stronger yong mans arme giues him in the braine, whereas the <hi>spirituall wisdome</hi> of the <hi>yongman</hi> increaseth daily. Thus then we interpret these words of the prophet, The heart of man is deceitfull, euen the whole heart of the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is wholly <hi>flesh,</hi> and part of the heart of the godly, namely the vnregenerate and fleshly part. The heart of the wicked is deceitfull with a full, strong, and reigning deceitfulnesse, the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that is in the heart of the godly is weaker, as being discerned of them, and strouen against by them, The heart of the wicked shewes it deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the <hi>whole course of their liues,</hi> The godly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>some particuler actions.</hi> As it is said of <hi>Dauid he was vpright in all things, saue only in the matter of Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> The generall current of his life was free from deceitfulnesse, though not the perticuler action;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19272:11"/> Contrarily the heart of the wicked may be vpright in <hi>some particular actions,</hi> as <hi>Abimelechs</hi> in the taking of <hi>Sarah. I know saith God thou hast done this in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 6.</note>
                  <hi>of thy heart:</hi> yet not in the <hi>maine</hi> of their liues. This is proper only to the godly that they are <hi>vpright in their way,</hi> that is the constant tenor of <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 2.</note> their conuersation. Now this deceitfulnesse heere giuen to the heart, is set forth, First, by the <hi>greatnesse of it: aboue all things.</hi> Secondly, by the <hi>cause of it: and euill.</hi> Thirdly, by the <hi>vnsearchablenesse of it,</hi> such that none can know it, figured with an interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>who can know it?</hi> that is none of himselfe by his owne mother wit, without a higher and clearer light.</p>
               <p>To begin first with the <hi>deceitfulnesse</hi> of the heart, <note place="margin">The originall of the hearts deceitfulnesse.</note> and then to come to the illustrations of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; It may be asked for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, How comes this deceitfulnesse into the heart? Is not the heart Gods creature? and did he not make it simple, plaine, and true? whence then this fraude? Lord thou sowedst in this field of mans heart the good corne of faith, truth, since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? whence then these tares? <hi>Salomon</hi> tels vs, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 31. <hi>God made man righteous: but they haue sought out many inuentions:</hi> for howsoeuer these <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions</hi> and deceits (as <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) were first forged in the Deuils braine, &amp; came out of his shop; yet because they were so readily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; as it were bought vp so fast by our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ascribes them to man. So that howsoeuer heere also the question concerning these <hi>tares,</hi> yea <hi>thistles</hi> of treachery, and a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19272:12"/> in our hearts may truly be answered with that in the Gospell. <hi>The enuious man hath sowen them;</hi> yet withall it may iustly be said, because the ground did so open hir mouth for them, that the field it selfe did bring them forth. If at the first, when as this field was as the pleasant <hi>Eden</hi> of God; how much more now, when, hauing the <hi>salt</hi> as it were of Gods curse sowen vpon it, it is become as a barren wildernesse? If <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> might bee charged as the first fathers, and founders of those deceitfull inuentions suggested by <hi>Sathan,</hi> because of their <hi>ready,</hi> how much more wee, because of our <hi>greedy</hi> apprehension of them, whereby wee drinke them in <hi>as the fish doth water?</hi> If they for <hi>willing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 15. 16.</note>
                  <hi>consenting to,</hi> how much more wee, for <hi>wilfull conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with</hi> the deuill? So that, whatsoeuer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures shall tell vs concerning the tempters wiles, wee may safely draw it hither, and apply it to our selues, partners, and practizers with <hi>Sathan</hi> in his stratagems against our owne soules.</p>
               <p>Wee see then the rocke, whereout this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">The difficulty of finding out this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> was hewen.

Indeed when our dead bodies are whole, wee cannot see what is within. They will cast forth an euil sauour, and we may see some filthinesse and deformity in them.

Surely the noses and eies, euen of some naturall men, haue discerned in mans heart vnope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, vnsauoury nastinesse, odious ouglinesse. But alas all that was not enough to humble them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it any thing to that they might haue seene in the heart broke vp by God, the only skilfull ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizer thereof.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the deceitfulnesse of the heart in regard of others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TAking then the anatomizing knife of the word, and ripping vp the belly of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, I finde such an infinite number of the veines of deceitfulnesse, and those so knotty and intricately infolded together, that hard it is distinctly, and cleerely to shew them all. Neuerthelesse, God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, wee shall doe our best endeauour. I thinke therefore that all the deceitfulnesse of the heart, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to vs in the word, may be reduced to these two heads. First, the deceitfulnesse, whereby we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">Deceit of heart two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note>
                  <hi>others only:</hi> Secondly that, whereby also we deceiue <hi>our selues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former is not that, which heere the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">1. Deceiuing others only. And it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> so much aimeth at. And therefore we will not so much insist vpon it. It shewes it selfe special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in two things; in <hi>dissimulation,</hi> and <hi>simulation,</hi> in dissembling and concealing that which indeede is, and in feigning, and counterfeiting that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is not. <hi>Dissimulation</hi> is either of <hi>euill</hi> or <hi>good.</hi> The dissembling of <hi>euill</hi> is threefold: Of euill <hi>to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Of Euill.</note>
                  <hi>bee done</hi> or <hi>in doing:</hi> secondly, <hi>from being done:</hi> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>already done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hearts deceitfulnesse in hiding that euill <note place="margin">1. To be done.</note> which shee purposeth to doe or is in doing, is to make faire euen of the quite contrary. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in hir witty wickednesse, shee inuenteth some
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19272:15"/> colourable pretence to shadow hir malice and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. When <hi>Herod</hi> intended <hi>woluishly</hi> to <hi>worrie</hi> Christ, he pretended yet <hi>religiously</hi> to <hi>worship</hi> him. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> cloked their purposed massacre of the Sichemites, with the conscience of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Absalom</hi> his treason, with the religion of his vow: <hi>Ioab</hi> his perfidiousnesse to <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> with friendly words, and siren-like salutations: <hi>Ismael</hi> his murtherous minde toward those eightie men, with his <hi>Crocodile teares: Iudas</hi> his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">Ier. 41. 6.</note> with a shew of a liberall and mercifull affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the poore: and the <hi>Iewes</hi> their <hi>enuie</hi> against <hi>Christ,</hi> with their <hi>dutie</hi> to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thinke ye that the Iewes cared for <hi>Caesar?</hi> No, none so impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of his yoke as they: But they had murtherous hearts, thirsting for our Lords bloud; that was the true cause; and the cause of their malicious heart was their <hi>euill eye,</hi> that could not indure the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brightnesse of his grace. But if they should haue alleaged that, all the world would haue cried shame on them: therefore to hide the odiousnesse of their fact, they set on it the faire maske of loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thus alwaies in the persecutions of <note place="margin">Iosephs coate. Gen. 37. 32. &amp; 39. 16.</note>
                  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> his <hi>coate</hi> shall be brought forth, as it was once by his enuious brethren, that sold him; by his whorish mistresse, that standered him. Some one specious and plausible pretence or other shall be deuised by the wicked, to saue their credit in the world. So like rowers in the boate, whilest in their <hi>pretence</hi> they looke one way, in their <hi>intent</hi> they go the cleane contrary. This trick of deceitfulnesse the heart hath learned of that arch-master of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19272:16"/> the Diuell. Who sometimes will needes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Preacher of the truth, as when he said, <hi>These are the seruants of the most high God &amp;c. Iesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, I know who thou art, euen the holy one of God:</hi> but <note place="margin">Mark. 1. 24.</note> yet he then plotteth mischiefe, thinking by one truth, to conuey and wind into our minds an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lies. Thus truth is made to vsher falshood: for euen in those his sugred glozing words, wherin he preacheth Christ the Sauior of the world, it is easy to spy out <hi>war in his hart,</hi> for it is to be marked, how <note place="margin">Beza in hunc locum.</note> he calleth him Iesus of <hi>Nazaret,</hi> thereby to nourish the error of the multitude, that thought he was borne there, and so not the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose birth <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> they all knew ought to be at <hi>Bethlem. Iesus</hi> then, and <hi>the holy one of God</hi> are <hi>butter</hi> and <hi>oile,</hi> as was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <note place="margin">Psal. 55.</note>
                  <hi>Good master thou regardest no mans person;</hi> but Iesus of <hi>Nazaret,</hi> that is a <hi>sword,</hi> as was afterward, <hi>Is it lawfull to giue tribute?</hi> And so that which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> speaketh of the flatterer, that <hi>he spreadeth a net</hi>

                  <hi>before his brothers feete,</hi> is true in those flattering speaches. The diuel sometimes giueth the truth: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he doth but set a snare to catch the truth in. As <hi>Saul,</hi> a good scholler in this schoole did for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> in giuing him <hi>Michol</hi> to wife: <hi>I will giue him hir,</hi> saith he, <hi>that shee may be a snare vnto him, and that the</hi>

And surely so it is often times, that as <hi>Saul</hi> hid himselfe in the stuffe, when he was

                  <hi>knowledge</hi> of that they can and ought to reueale: for being sometimes posed with some questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future euents, and not knowing well what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19272:20"/> to answere, and yet not willing to loose his credit with his blind worshippers either by silence or plaine speech, he shaped his answeres in such an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous houering manner, that which way soeuer the euent should fall out, it could not fall out amisse to his answere; because, being vpheld with this prop of equiuocation, it would stand true euen in contrary euents. Thus when in his Prophets he was demaunded by <hi>Ahab</hi> concerning his going to war <note place="margin">1. Kings 22. 6. opened.</note> against <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> and the successe thereof, hee answered, <hi>Go, the Lord will deliuer it into the hand of the King.</hi> Yea, but of what <hi>King,</hi> thou lying equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating spirit? whether into the hands of the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary</hi> King to be subdued, or of it <hi>owne</hi> King to be rescued and deliuered? This hee determines not, but speaketh suspensely &amp; vncertainly to gul <hi>Ahab,</hi> and make him runne headlong vpon his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. And yet heere once againe marke, how the Diuels equiuocating is not all out so bad, as the <note place="margin">The Diuell confesseth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation to be lying, which is more then Iesuites will doe.</note> Iesuites: for he confesseth his equiuocating to be plaine lying; I will go saith he and be a <hi>lying spirit</hi> in the mouthes of the Prophets. He was only an equiuocating spirit in their mouthes: for the words in some sense, and as the <hi>Deuill</hi> might interpret them might bee true, and yet hee grants that his wordes, though neuer so qualified with equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quirks, were no better then lies. But the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, not hauing so much as the Deuils ingenuity in thē, stick not to iustifie their equiuocations as iust and lawfull. The wicked deceitfulnesse whereof the Diuells practise, euen of it selfe alone, without his confession, is sufficient to discouer; for (besides
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19272:20"/> the example already mentioned, and his daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in his crooked Oracles among the Heathen) thus dealt he at the first with our first parents, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that by eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>their</hi>

The Diuell indeed meant onely this latter, possessing yet the minds of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> with an apprehension, and expectation of the former. Now if the diuell should haue bin chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for deceiuing, had not his defence beene ready with this shield of equiuocation; might he not haue said, euen that which <hi>Moses</hi> hauing reference to this his speech speaketh ver. 7. why? are not my words true? are not your eies now opened to see your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which before you saw not? do not you know your selues to be naked, and so haue not you that knowledge of euill which I promised, euen a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge arising out of your owne experience? and yet for all this, <hi>Paul</hi> for this fact calls him a cosener, and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3.

Now howsoeuer they that do euill are indeed euil in regard of the first kind of euill, yet not in regard of the second. When a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour weares long haire, he doth euill, but yet he is not euill in that kinde of wickednesse, which this action seemes to importe. For to weare long haire is commonly a badge of a royster, or ruffian, yet the professour is not such a one indeed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes shew of that euill to be in him, which indeed is not. For as a man may bely himselfe in wordes, as hee that told <hi>Dauid</hi> hee had slaine <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1.</note> when indeede he had not; so also in his deedes, which also haue their language. And this is, when we do some lesser euill, that caries with it a foule note, and shrewd suspition of a greater euill, of the which yet we are innocent. If <hi>Ioseph</hi> with his mouth should haue said, I care for the true God as little, as the Aegyptians, who seeth not, but that he should haue feyned that wickednesse to bee in himselfe, which in truth was not? Now by swearing by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:19272:23"/> life in effect hee said as much.</p>
               <p>These be the deceits of <hi>dissimulation:</hi> The deceit <note place="margin">2. Simulation.</note> of <hi>simulation</hi> is specially, that whereby men make shew of that grace and godlinesse which either they haue not at all, or else not in that measure they make shew of, being specially swayed with the sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster respects of gaine and glory. To make shew of more grace then indeed is, may be incident to the godly: but to make shew of grace when there is not any at all, no not so much as the least liking of it, this is peculiar to the wicked. With whom that mischieuous <hi>Machiauilian</hi> precept so much preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; <hi>That vertue it selfe should not be sought after, but</hi>

And as <hi>Iakob</hi> thereby deceiued <hi>Isack,</hi> so doe these often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the most iudicious Christians; like as the figge-tree with her leaues deceiued <hi>Christ,</hi> and as the empty boxes in Apothecaries shops, with their faire titles written vpon them, deceiue the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant commers in. Though their hearts be base, and vile earthen pots, yet they must be ouerlaidē with the siluer drosse of glozing, and glorious wordes. Thus hypocrites speake not <hi>out of,</hi> but <hi>contrary to</hi> the abundance of their hearts. When their lips, like good mens, scatter knowledge, their hearts at the same time, naughtinesse.

Did they not make great shews of more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary humility &amp; mortification? or what austerity is there among the Papists, or what zeale in wooing and winning of Proselites, with which that of the Pharisees may not compare? Try wee then the spirits before we trust them, for though men may compose their faces and fashions to neuer so great showes of piety, yet for all that <hi>seauen abominations</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 7 16. interpreted.</note> may lye couched in their deceitfull hearts. And therefore when our Sauiour tels vs that <hi>by their fruites we shall know</hi> false Prophets, hee meaneth not so much the fruits of their liues, which in outward apparance, and in the indgement of men, may be as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19272:25"/> good, as the true Prophets; (for they come in sheepes clothing) as of their doctrine. That wee must heed specially, trying it by the word, and not be carried away with the pompous ostentation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their words or works.</p>
               <p>So also among our selues, wee must not presently reach foorth the right hand of fellowship to euery one that beginneth to cry Lord, Lord; but first we must weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary, to see whether they be current mettall, or no. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hues</hi> question is fit for all good Christians to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to such as <hi>Iehu</hi> was, before they admit them into their society, <hi>Is thy heart vpright?</hi> As Christ <note place="margin">2▪ Kin. 10. 15.

See how scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous the Christians were at first to receiue S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> into their company, which was not so much <hi>dainty nicenesse,</hi> as <hi>iust cantelousnesse,</hi> whereto the deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of mans heart doth necessarily vrge vs. It is not good indeed to wrong any man with <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suspitions,</hi> so neither is it good to wrong our selues with <hi>ouer easie credulity.</hi> The same spirit that saith, <hi>Charity beleeueth all things,</hi> saith also that <hi>a foole</hi>

                  <hi>beleeueth all things.</hi> And <hi>charity</hi> is no <hi>foole.</hi> As it is not <hi>easily suspitious,</hi> so neither <hi>lightly credulous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly we must all take notice of this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hearts, wherby we are ready to deceiue our brethren, what by <hi>feigning,</hi> what by dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. As Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of sinne in generall, so <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19272:26"/> to take notice of this in others, and wee may heare foule mouthed persons casting the aspersion of hypocrisie vpon such as deserue it farre lesse then themselues.

                  <p>Of the deceit whereby we iudge our selues not to be so euil, as indeed weare.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE haue breefly runne ouer the former <note place="margin">2. part of harts deceitfulnesse, selfe de-ceit which is</note> part of the hearts deceitfulnesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it deceiueth <hi>others,</hi> not <hi>it selfe,</hi> with the seuerall parcels thereof: now we come to the second part of deceitfulnesse, and that farre more deepe, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then the former, namely that which wee may call <hi>selfe-deceit,</hi> whereby wee deceiue euen <hi>our selues,</hi> sometimes together with, sometimes againe without deceiuing others besides.</p>
               <p>This deceitfulnesse may be considered either in the mind or affections <hi>iointly together,</hi> or in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">twofold.</note>
                  <hi>separately,</hi> and <hi>by themselues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former deceitfulnesse shewes it selfe special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in 4. things: 1. in <hi>iudging,</hi> 2. in <hi>perswading,</hi> 3. in <note place="margin">1. In the mind and affections ioynctly shewing it selfe in foure things. 1. In iudging.</note>
                  <hi>promising,</hi> 4. in <hi>practising.</hi> For the first which is in <hi>iudging;</hi> though it may seeme that iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs properly to the mind, yet because heere the affections interpose themselues, and the erroneous iudgement of the mind commonly receiueth it tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from the affections, I do therefore equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest both the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> in this first <hi>deceit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: where 3. Deceits. 1. Deceit is, That we are not so ill as we are either in regard of the time.</note> Now the deceit of the heart in iudging is either in iudging of our <hi>persons,</hi> or of our <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In iudging of our <hi>persons</hi> there are specially three <hi>deceits;</hi> whereof the <hi>first</hi> is, when we think, through pride, and ignorance, that we are not so bad, as in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19272:28"/> truth we are. And this deceit is not only in regard of that wee iudge of our selues for the time <hi>present,</hi> but also <hi>past,</hi> and to <hi>come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the time <hi>present;</hi> how many are there grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1. Present.</note> tainted with many horrible sinnes, which yet in no case they wil be brought to see, or acknowledge, nay so far are they blinded through <hi>selfe-loue,</hi> and <hi>selfe deceit,</hi> that they will bee at daggers drawing with any that shal offer to lay such matters to their charge The Pharisee cackles and crakes in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 11.</note> that hee is not <hi>vniust,</hi> nor an <hi>extortioner,</hi> hee thought himselfe free enough from those sinnes, &amp; yet our Sauiour, who could not be deceiued, faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this imputation vpon that whole <hi>tribe,</hi> that howsoeuer the outside of the cup, and platter were very exquisitely mundified, yet the inside was <hi>full of rauenings and wickednesse.</hi> Whereupon he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Luk 13. 39. vers. 41.</note> them by almes to make cleane those dishes, which euen swimmed with bloud, in regarde the meates in them, were gotten by euil meanes, as by deuouring of widdowes houses, through colour of long prayers; by teaching children euen to sterue their owne parents, to offer to the altar, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to their paunches, and purses. Was not this vniustice and extortion? and yet because it was something more cleanly carried, and not so grosse, and apparant, as that of the <hi>Publicanes,</hi> or common theeues, therefore he blesseth himselfe in a supposed freedome from that sinne, and triumpheth saying, <hi>I am no extortioner, no vniust person;</hi> Nay out of thine owne mouth shalt thou be iudged, thou deceitfull Pharisee. That shall cast thee, for when after thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19272:29"/> saist, <hi>nor as this publican;</hi> is not this shamefull iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for thee to <hi>iudge another mans seruant, that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or falleth to his owne master?</hi> And when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thou gloriest in thine owne vertues, of fasting &amp; paying of tithes, as though by these things thou hadst deserued to be kept by God, from breaking out into the scandals of adultery, and extortion, are not thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n extortioner in the highest degree, that goest about to extort, and wring from God himselfe his most pretious treasure, his glory, which he will not giue to another? Thus many with the Pharisee thinke themselues innocent enough of theft, and such like crimes, and will wish they could no more be touched with other sinnes, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they haue their hands very deepe in these transgressions, vsually robbing their brethren of their good name, which being aboue siluer &amp; gold, the theft thereof must needs, proportionably, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <note place="margin">Prou. 22. 1.</note> the theft of siluer and gold which is punished with the gallowes; nay robbing God himselfe of his worship: of his Sabbath, the time, and of his <hi>tithes,</hi> the <hi>props</hi> of his worship. What a mockery is <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8.</note> it then for thee to talke of paying man his dues, when thou deniest God his? Or is it theft to rob thy fellow subiect, and none to rob thy King, and souereigne? So againe we may heare others purge themselues of couetousnesse, as though they were not at all giuen that way, onely vpon this ground, because they are no miching, and scraping nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes, but rather wastfull, and riotous prodigals. Not considering that their prodigality cannot be vpheld, but by couetousnesse, in seeking for more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19272:29"/> then God hath alotted, and that by vngodly, and vniust practises. So others free themselues of pride, only because they exceede not in their apparrell, as others, when yet inwardly they are swollen with selfe-conceit, and no men thinke better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then they doe. Our ruffling, and swashing cutters, with whom a <hi>word</hi> and a <hi>blowe,</hi> a <hi>lie</hi> and a <hi>stabbe,</hi> thinke themselues of an <hi>heroicall</hi> spirit, and in no hand would indure the imputation of Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, of basenesse of mind, and cowardize. Yet the truth is they are most base, and vile cowardes, slauishly yeelding to their owne vile affections, which to ouercome, and by repentance to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of, is a farre greater argument of a noble &amp; generous spirit, thē to pursue so egerly the reuenge of euery petty iniurie, which the Apostle disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth by a word that signifieth <hi>infirmity,</hi> and <hi>losse of victory.</hi> If it were true valour, why should not <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 7. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> they be as hazardous of their estates, and liues for Christes sake, and the gospell, when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires? But then none so faint hearted, &amp; dastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they. Infinite were it to follow all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, whereby this deceit might be exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Of all others this is the most generall branch thereof, when men thinke they haue not such and such corruptions, because they feele not the powerfull operation of them, by reason of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning hande. Many naturall men there are whom God neuer renewed by his grace, in whom yet he so moderateth, and bridleth many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as pride, lust, cruelty, &amp;c: that they breake not forth. Hence such men deceitfully imagine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19272:30"/> that they are framed of some purer mould, and are of a better nature, and disposition, free altogether from such corruptions, because free from the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them. As though a Lion were no Lion, when fettered, that hee cannot rampe, or a theefe no theefe when manacled, that he cannot steale, or the stone no stone, when so bedded in the bladder, that it cannot greatly vexe: Lest therefore wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our selues in this point, it standeth vs in hand diligently to examine whether the <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>silence</hi> of our corruption be from the <hi>restraining,</hi> or the <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> spirit, from the Grace of God <hi>suppressing</hi> it, or <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> it, from want of a <hi>mind disposed,</hi> or of an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi> to be <hi>proposed</hi> for the drawing forth of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>
               <p>As thus we are deceiued in iudging of our selues <note place="margin">2. Past.</note> for the time <hi>present,</hi> so also <hi>past</hi> and to <hi>come:</hi> for the <hi>time past,</hi> we haue an example in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that said, if they had liued in the daies of their Fathers, they would not haue murthered the Prophets, when <note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> yet their bloudy persecution of <hi>Christ,</hi> that taught no other doctrine, then that which the Prophets of old had done, might sufficiently discouer the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of their harts in this kind. Thus what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miscreant is there, that will not bee ready to crye out vpon the high Priests, the Iewes and trecherous <hi>Iudas,</hi> with the rest, that had their hands in Christs bloud; and as for them, if they had then liued, they should haue taken <hi>Christs</hi> part against the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and so <hi>Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Bradfords</hi> part against <hi>Bonner</hi> &amp; <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener?</hi> A likely matter: they now make so much of those, in whom the piety, and zeale of those holy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19272:30"/> martyrs is reuiued. Assuredly, hee that now, vnder the Gospell, sheweth a spiteful, and malitious mind to a good, and holy Christian, well may he deceiue himselfe, hee shall neuer deceiue mee so farre, as to make me thinke otherwise, then that if he had liued in holy <hi>Hoopers</hi> daies, hee would haue beene readie, with the forwardest, to haue carried a fagot to his stake, yea if he had liued in Christs daies, hee would haue he one ready to haue driuen in the first nayle into his body. Certainly, an <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> to <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> would haue beene an <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezabell</hi> to <hi>Elias.</hi> And yet I make no question, but if one had asked either <hi>Herod</hi> or <hi>Herodias,</hi> what they thought of <hi>Ahabs</hi> &amp; <hi>Iezabels</hi> dealings toward <hi>Elias,</hi> and what they would haue done in like case, I doubt not I say, but they would haue condemned thē to the very pit of hell, and made many goodly protestations, that if they had then liued, they would haue done farre otherwise: But in asmuch as they did the same things to a new <hi>Elias,</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> that came <hi>in the spirit and power of Elias:</hi> it was thereby euident what they would haue done to the old <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, we deceiue our selues in regard of the time <note place="margin">3. To come.</note>
                  <hi>to come,</hi> when we wil not take that notice of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as to think we are in danger of falling heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after into those grosse and scandalous sinnes, which hetherto we haue auoided: thus, many wil not stick <hi>Thrasonically</hi> to boast, that if <hi>Poperie</hi> and persecution of the truth should againe reenter, yet they should neuer shrink. But a notable example for this purpose is that of <hi>Peter,</hi> who had so opened his eares to the voyce of his owne deceitfull and lying heart, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19272:31"/> hee could not beleeue <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, the God of truth, forewarning him of his threefold deniall, hee could not be perswaded there was so much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his heart. So <hi>Hazael,</hi> when the Prophet told <note place="margin">2. Kings 8. 13.</note> him he should cruelly rip vp the women with child, and dash their children against the stones, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king better of himselfe, then that euer hee should breake forth into such outrage, answered, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some indignation, <hi>What am I a dogge?</hi> Yea that thou art, <hi>Hazael;</hi> and so naturally are al the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> in their vitious qualities worse then dogges, beares, tigers. And thus, if our own harts deceiue vs not, shall we iudge of our selues, that there is no sin so odious vnto which of our selues we are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inclinable. For <hi>originall sin,</hi> in which we are all bred &amp; born, conteineth in it selfe the <hi>seeds</hi> of all sins, that fearful sin against the holy G. it selfe not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore by reason of this so corrupt &amp; rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a nature, wee haue a disposition, euen the best of vs, to the vilest &amp; most loathsome sinnes. One would haue thought that the Disciples, in regard of their educatiō &amp; nurture, both vnder their <hi>parentes,</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest &amp; frugal trades, and vnder our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> in holy &amp; spirituall learning should haue bin farre enough frō <hi>surfeting</hi> &amp; <hi>drunkennes,</hi> the sins of <hi>swaggerers,</hi> &amp; not of sober, ciuill men, much lesse godly &amp; zealous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. And yet vnto them our <hi>Sauiour</hi> addresseth this admonition, <hi>Take heede vnto your selues that your harts be not made heauy with surfeting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 21. 34.</note> For they had in them the common poison of nature, and so were obnoxious euen to the most shamefull and roproachfull euils. And yet, for all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19272:31"/> this, whose heart is there free from this deceit, of thinking himselfe free enough, and far enough from many, specially hatefull, and ignominious sinnes, as murther, theft, adultery, periury, apostacy and such like? Would not <hi>Dauid,</hi> thinke we, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> admonished of his future denial, haue made strange of it, if it had bene told him before hand, thou shalt defile <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> murther <hi>Vriah?</hi> Would he not haue <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</note> answered with <hi>Hazael, what am I a dogge?</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is exceeding dangerous, and therefore take wee heed of it. For whence is it, that men oftentimes, as it seemeth of mild and gentle natures, breake foorth into great rage, euen vnto murther, and againe men of chast behauiour into filthy and brutish vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: whence is this I say, but from this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our harts, whereby we perswade our selues, that our nature is not so far venomed, that it should be likely to bring forth such pestilent euils? and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore growing secure, and remitting of our watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we are the more easily ouerthrowen. Indeede some sinnes there are to which wee are not so much tempted, as others (as <hi>Luther</hi> saide of himselfe, that he neuer felt himselfe tempted to couetousnes:) yet there is no sinne, but we may both be tempted to, &amp; through temptation fall into, if Gods vnderprop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand withdraw it selfe. As the <hi>Apostle</hi> notably teacheth, exhorting to moderation towards our brethren fallen euē into fouler sins, vpō this ground, <hi>Considering thy selfe that thou maist bee tempted,</hi> euen with a powerfull and preuailing temptation, to fall into thy brothers sinne. The vse then of this point is to take heede of this deceit, and knowing our selues
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19272:32"/> what wee are, to tremble and to feare euen those sinnes, which wee least suspect, and whereto wee find not our selues so pronely carried, as to others. Wee would be loath to trust a beare or wolfe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such like beast though by culture and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their youth their inborne fiercenesse bee something mitigated. Still their naturall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sticks to them, and that will teach them to doe mischiefe Why then should wee repose any such confidence in our selues, that wee shall neuer lash out into such and such euils? Wee haue a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master within, that naturall corruption that cleaues so fast vnto vs, that will be readie to teach vs, yea to vrge and force vs to the very height of iniquitie. Few will so trust their bodies, though neuer so sound and healthy, but that they will feare euen the most dangerous diseases, as the pox, the plague, and such like infections; for that they know that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the bodies of the best constitution haue matter within, euen for the vilest disease to worke vpon. Assuredly thy <hi>soule</hi> is a farre more fruitfull <hi>seminary</hi> of <hi>sinnes,</hi> then thy <hi>body</hi> of <hi>diseases.</hi> Why then shouldest thou suffer thy selfe to be deceiued more in the one then in the other?

                  <p>Of the deceits of three seuerall sorts of men, the rich worldling, the ciuill iustitiary, the loose libertine.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SO much of the <hi>first deceit</hi> in iudging of our <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second Deceit is, that our bad estate is good: where there are</note> The second followeth. And that is when wee thinke our selues in good and happy estate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, being indeed miserable; when with the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> wee iudge our selues rich and <note place="margin">Reuel. 3.</note> wanting nothing, when indeed wee are poore, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, blind and beggerly wretches. <hi>If any man,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Paul, thinke himselfe somewhat, when he is nothing, hee</hi> deceiueth <hi>himself in his imagination.</hi> Now what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>somewhat</hi> then for a man to be happy? what greater <hi>nothing</hi> then to be miserable? and so what greater <hi>deceit</hi> then this, for a man being miserable to iudge himselfe happy, being in Gods deepe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure to account himselfe to be highly in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour? A deceit indeede very common, but also very dangerous: for in this case mans deceitfull and dreaming heart makes him like that dreamer of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who though hungry and thirstie, yet in <note place="margin">Esay 29. 8.</note> his sleepe thinkes he hath meat and drinke; but as he awakened sees his error and feeles his hunger, so shall the heart aroused by God, at least at the day of iudgement, see her deceit and feele hir miserie. Surely as in the naturall dreames it is better, when they be false, they should be of fearefull things, then of ioyfull, as better for a <hi>King</hi> to dreame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee a <hi>begger,</hi> then contrarily for a <hi>begger</hi> to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19272:34"/> dreame that hee is a <hi>King:</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> when hee wakens, his griefe is gone and his ioy is redoubled, seeing the vanitie of his dreame, but the begger when he awakes, his former griefe that slept with him awakes, and returnes so much the fiercer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the false ioy of his dreame: so is it in these dreames and deceitfull dotages of the heart. Farre better is that deceit, whereby the sonne of <hi>God</hi> thinkes himselfe a slaue of <hi>Sathan,</hi> than the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the limme of <hi>Sathan</hi> deemes and dreames himselfe a member of <hi>Christ.</hi> Better it is for <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> being a man, through his braine distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with melancholly to thinke himselfe a beast, then for a beast to thinke it selfe a man: for this deceit is nothing so vsuall, nor so perilous. A mans false conceit of misery, when indeede he is happy, may lessen his happinesse: it cannot make him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: But a mans false apprehension of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being miserable, is so farre from making him happy, that it makes him twise, yea remedilesse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; it being the first step to happinesse to know our miserie. Lamentable therefore is it, that this deceit being so pernitious, should be so vniuersall. Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> tels vs that there are but few that shall be saued. And yet if all they should be saued, that thinke they shall be saued, sure then there are but very few that shal be damned, &amp; then the <hi>strait</hi> and <hi>narrow way</hi> is that which leadeth to Hell, the <hi>broad way</hi> is Heauen way: For who is there almost that perswadeth not himselfe hee shall be saued?</p>
               <p>And heere I obserue more specially the deceit of <note place="margin">Foure deceits.</note> foure seuerall sorts of men; the <hi>rich worldling,</hi> the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19272:34"/>
                  <hi>ciuil iustitiarie,</hi> the <hi>loose libertine,</hi> or <hi>carnall gospeller,</hi> and the <hi>temporarie beleeuer;</hi> all these vpon their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall, but all of them deceiuable grounds, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues, they are in the fauour of God.</p>
               <p>First, the men of this world, whose bellies God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> filleth with the hid treasure of the earth, vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <note place="margin">Rich world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings deceit. Psal. 17.</note> of their outward prosperity, are quickly brought into this fooles paradise of thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be the speciall darlings of God: for if the godly themselues haue oftentimes their eies so da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled with the outward glittering and flourishing estate of the wicked, as thereupon they are ready to say of them, <hi>The generation of Gods children,</hi> which <note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> was once <hi>Dauids</hi> error for a time: how much more then, thinke wee, will the wicked thinke so of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? <hi>He that maketh gaine,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid, blesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 3.</note> namely in this false opinion of his owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. And elsewhere hee sheweth that when God <hi>holdeth his peace,</hi> and doth not by his iudgements <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> disturbe them in their pleasures and profits, then presently their deceitfull heart thereon inferreth, that <hi>God is like to them,</hi> he alloweth of them and their doings. That we may free these men from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and discouer the grossenesse of it, diuers things must be considered.</p>
               <p>First, If riches be that that makes men happy, (according to the foolish phrase men vse when such things befall one, <hi>O he is made!)</hi> how then comes it to passe, that Heauen the cheefe and royall seate of blessednesse, is so empty of these treasurers? for there grow no minerals, the veine of siluer &amp; gold is not to be found there. And yet <hi>God</hi> who there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19272:35"/> sheweth the brightest lustre of his glorie, the holy <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> that dwell there with him, want nothing that may serue to make them <hi>completely</hi> blessed. Surely belike happinesse must be digged out of the bowels of the earth, it growes below, not aboue. The earth can no longer say, when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of our happinesse, as it is in <hi>Iob, it is not in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 28. 14.</note>
                  <hi>mee;</hi> if siluer and gold be our happinesse, then it is in the earth, and so, which is strange, it is neerer <hi>hell</hi> (which the scripture seemeth to place below i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the deepes) then <hi>heauen,</hi> which all knowe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, <note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> and so neerer the <hi>Diuell,</hi> then <hi>God</hi> let me haue <hi>heauens miserie,</hi> take thou <hi>hels happinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 If this deceit be true, happinesse should rather be found in the <hi>wildernesse</hi> of <hi>India, Turkey,</hi> and such like barbarous, and brutish places, then in the faire <hi>Eden</hi> of the Church. Is it likely, that if riches were such pearls, the Lord would cast them to such <hi>swine?</hi> if such happie things, he would throw them to such <hi>dogges?</hi> if the childrens bread, hee would feed whelpes with them?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Riches indeed themselues are the good bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes of God, and are notable instruments of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as we see in <hi>Salomon, Abraham, Lot,</hi> and other holy rich men in the scripture, in all whom that saying was true, <hi>Wisedome is good with an inheritance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 13. interpreted.</note> Wisedome is good without an inheritance to the <hi>owner,</hi> but it is not so good to <hi>others,</hi> it cannot so cleerely shew, and manifest it selfe to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of this instrument. As how could <hi>Abraham</hi> haue shewed his hospitall, and bountifull minde, in intertaining strangers, if poore? How
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19272:35"/> could <hi>Iob</hi> haue declared his mercy, and liberality to the poore, without his riches? how could <hi>Salomon</hi> haue witnessed his munificence, &amp; royall magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, yea his zeale, and piety in building the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, together with his wisedome and skill in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall philosophy, had not the Lord so abundantly furnished him with these helpes? what then? shall wee say, because riches are the instruments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vertue declareth it selfe, therefore they make men vertuous? that, because a good pen is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of writing, therefore it will make one a good writer? nay rather a good writer makes the pen good, and to bee a fit instrument of writing well. For furnish an vnskilfull writer with neuer so good a pen, yet his fist remaines still as vnskilfull. So a good man knowes how to make vse, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of riches, for the practise of vertue; as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> saies, <hi>The crowne of the wise is their riches:</hi> but <note place="margin">Pro. 14. 24. cleered.</note> yet giue them a foole, and you put a sword into a mad mans hand, still hee is as wicked, naie worse then before, as <hi>Salomon</hi> addeth in the same place, <hi>the folly of fooles,</hi> namely rich ones, <hi>is foolishnes;</hi> why, was it not foolishnes before they were rich? yes, but not in comparison of that it is now, since they became rich. That as <hi>wisedome is good,</hi> that is, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shines brighter, so <hi>folly is naught,</hi> that is, farre worse, more palpably discouers it selfe, <hi>with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> That which <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes of <hi>silence</hi> in a foole, may as truely be said of <hi>pouerty</hi> sometimes. <note place="margin">Prou. 17. 28.</note> A foole is accounted wise while poore, but let him once be rich, then his follie is foolishnesse indeed. Riches then declare whether wee be good, or no,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19272:36"/> as a sword in a mans hand whether he be sober, or drunke, but they make vs not good; because, as I said, they are only instruments of goodnesse. And the instrument alwaies receiueth it force from that which vseth it, giueth none vnto it. Were it not absurd for a man to thinke himselfe a good scholer, because he hath many bookes standing in his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, or a good musition, because he hath many mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall instruments hanging vpon his wals, when he knowes not how to vse either bookes, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And yet riches are no such necessary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>grace,</hi> as bookes are of <hi>learning.</hi> For a man may shew as much, naie (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath well <note place="margin">Hom. 1. ad pop. Antioch.</note> noted in the example of <hi>Iob)</hi> more of some obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence namely that which we call <hi>passiue</hi> in pouertie, then in riches.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Riches, though they be the giftes of God, yet we must consider, with what hand hee reacheth them forth vnto vs, whether with the right, or the left, with what mind he giueth them, whether in loue, or in anger. For God often giueth men riches as he gaue the Israelites quayles, euen to be <hi>thornes</hi> to choake them. Herein being like that King <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapeles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Drus. in adag.</note> that heaped vp most riches vpon such as he most hated, saying that together with their riches hee should crush them with a heauy burden of cares. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himselfe was not smitten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those judgements, wherin others perished, but it was not from any speciall respect God had of him aboue them, but God himselfe, least he should misiinterprete it, tels him the reason <hi>for this cause</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 9. 16. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted vide Iun.</note>
                  <hi>haue Ireserued thee,</hi> namely from being stroken with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19272:36"/> the former judgement, not for any loue I beare to thee, but, <hi>that I may shew my power in thee.</hi> The <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> therefore excellently couples these thinges to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>The Lord giueth fight to the blind, hee raiseth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 146. 8. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.</note>
                  <hi>vp the crooked, he loueth the righteous.</hi> To teach that the Lord may dispense these outward blessinges to the wicked, but not in loue, saue only to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Wherefore our <hi>rich worldling</hi> hath little cause of reioycing in his riches, vnlesse hee knew that the Lord <hi>looked vpon him,</hi> as Elizabeth speaketh of the <note place="margin">Luc. 1. 25.</note> blessing of hir fruitfull wombe, in the giuinge of them, euen with a sweete, and amiable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ready together with his riches to <hi>deale his owne soule</hi> vnto him. But it is otherwise: The Lord turneth his backe vpon him, euen then when his hand reacheth forth these outward thinges vnto him. In his <hi>anger</hi> he giueth these supposed faelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the wicked, which in his <hi>mercy</hi> he denieth to the godly. He putteth them into the fatter pastures, because he meaneth to kill them, and causeth these to feede on the bare commons, because he will haue them liue still. If the stalled oxe had reason, would he be so senselesse as to thinke his master loued him better then his fellowes, because of his more liberall foode? know it then thou rich worldling God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fatteth thee for the slaughter. Hee thus ladeth thee with these blessinges that by this meanes ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating thy ingratitude, and impenitency, hee <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> might lade thee with a heauier weight of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Yea by this meanes in his iust judgement, as by an outward occasion, he prouoketh, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp that corruption of pride, couetousnesse,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19272:37"/> cruelty, oppression, and such like, which before were in thee, but for want of occasion could not so plainly shew themselues. That therfore this secret corruptiō may be discouered, he offreth fit matter for it to feed vpon, toworke vpon. <hi>Iudas</hi> was couetous before hee came to Christ: therfore Christ gaue him the bag to feed that his humor, to minister fuell to it, that so his rotten heart might be detected, should not now <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> haue deceiued himselfe much, if hee had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the office which Christ assigned him, as an argument of his grearer respect, as though hee had reposed more confidence in him for fidelity, whome indeed he knew to be most vnfaithful? <hi>Iudas</hi> bag was a net to catch his soule. The wickeds <hi>table,</hi> though swimming neuer so much with dainties, is <hi>his snare</hi> &amp; <hi>his prosperity his ruine.</hi> God giueth them these things <note place="margin">Psa. 69. 22.</note> no otherwise then <hi>Iael</hi> gaue <hi>Sisera</hi> milke, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that by this means casting them into the dead sleep of security, he might strike them through with the naile of his iudgements, or as <hi>Ehud</hi> gaue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to <hi>Eglon,</hi> onely that he might haue an occasion to sheath his dagger in his bowels: wherefore looke how <hi>Haman</hi> deceiued himselfe in construing the Queenes inuitation of him to the banquet, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of speciall grace: for indeede shee did it onely to accuse him; alike doe these fatte worldlings deceiue themselues, imputing their outward prosperity to the fauour of God, who indeede onely giueth them these things to furnish their inditemēt out of them; like as once <hi>Ioseph</hi> caused his cup to bee put into one of his brethrens sacks, that he might picke a quarrell with them, and lay theft to their charge: for God,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19272:37"/> howsoeuer he haue giuen the wicked these earthly blessings, yet will he chalenge them of theft, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust vsurping of his creatures, to the which being out of Christ, they haue no right and title. See then ye miserable mucke wormes of the earth, how grossely yee deceiue your selues, that are so fearefull of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued by others, and know that as in other regards, so in this hath our <hi>Sauiour befooled</hi> you, that <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> you thus lull your selues a sleepe in a false conceit of your owne happinesse, and sing a <hi>requiem</hi> to your owne soules, <hi>soule take thine ease;</hi> and yet <hi>sinne lies before the doores; this night ô foole shall they take away thy soule:</hi> and then though with <hi>Diues</hi> ye haue bin <hi>rich in this world,</hi> yet with him also ye shal be poore, enough in the World to come: so poore that yee shall bee driuen to begge <hi>a droppe of water</hi> of <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> some <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to whom heere you denied <hi>crummes of bread.</hi> O extreame and more then beggerly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, when thou canst not commaund a little drop of water! So fitly did the Apostle say, charge them that are rich in this world, intimating that there is one riches &amp; pouerty of this world, &amp; of the world to come another, as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> poore in this world, became rich in the other world, and <hi>Diues,</hi> rich in this world, became exceeding penurious in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: withall teaching that these riches, when they last longest, last no longer then this life, they follow not after vs when wee are dead, to make vs rich in that other world; Go now and blesse thy selfe in thy riches, and prosperous estate as badges of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; from which holy <hi>Agur</hi> desired to bee blessed; fearing least his shoe being ouerwide for his foote it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19272:38"/> would but hinder him in his iourney, and his ouer-ample estate would be as cumbersome to his soule, as <hi>Sauls</hi> armour would haue beene to <hi>Dauids</hi> body. The Apostle tels thee, <hi>God chasteneth euery child hee</hi>

Sort of men deceiuing themselues in this <note place="margin">Ciuill Iustitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries deceit.</note> kind are our <hi>ciuill iustitiaries,</hi> who therefore iudge themselues to be in good state to <hi>God-ward,</hi> because they liue without scandall honestly, quietly paying euery man his owne &amp;c. If they had hence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they had beene in good state to <hi>man-ward,</hi> the deceit had beene more tolerable; for men cannot so well chalenge those that can with <hi>Samuel</hi> say, <hi>whose oxe or asse haue I stollen?</hi> whom haue I wronged? but the deceit is fond, to thinke therefore God can haue no action against thee. Alike as if thou shouldest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19272:38"/> thinke the King can touch thee in nothing, because thou hast not failed in any point, the Law tyes thee to thy fellow-subiects, with whom thou liuest, and yet happily hast many waies faulted against the king himselfe: Thou talkest of paying men their dues; wel let it be so: what can follow hence, but that among men thou shalt go for an honest man? what with God too? yes, if thou canst truly say, thou paist him his dues; the due of prayer, hearing, reading, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating in the worde, sanctifiing of the Sabbaoths, the which our ciuill man neuer paieth, and therfore as thou wouldst account him vnhonest, that paies thee not thy dues, so will God account thee, for not paying him his. <hi>This is true religion</hi> saith <hi>Iames</hi> to the loose professor seuering some outward duties of religion in the first, from righteousnesse in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, <hi>to visit the Fatherlesse and widdow</hi> &amp;c. which are duties not of <hi>religion</hi> properly, but of <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and</hi> righteousnesse: and this hee doth because this is the triall of the truth of our religion. By like reason and proportion may I say to the <hi>Ciuil man,</hi> as vnreasonably diuiding the works of righteousnes, in the second table, from those of religion, in the first, This is true righteousnesse, this is true honesty, to sanctifie the Sabbaoths, to call vpon the name of the Lord, to conferre, to meditate of the word: For looke what kind of Religion that is, which is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>honesty</hi> to men, alike is that <hi>honesty</hi> which is not ioyned with <hi>Religion</hi> to God. Now the former religion none so ready to condemne for naught as the ciuill man himselfe: for zeale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in no case can he away with: therefore, his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19272:39"/> owne mouth being iudge, his owne honesty which he so magnifies and makes the only prop of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse must needs be rotten, and vnsound. <hi>Vnhonest religion</hi> is as good, as <hi>irreligious honesty.</hi> And if in thy iudgement, the former be naught, surely the latter cannot be good. Religion, or the feare of God <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> cals the <hi>head</hi> of all goodnesse: honesty then without religion is as a body without a head, euen a rotting, and stinking carrion: and wilt thou yet be so fond as to thinke it is a sweet smelling sacrifice in Gods nosethrils? Heare <hi>Christ</hi> telling the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> such as thou art, that the <hi>harlots and Publicanes,</hi> as if I should now say to thee <hi>cut-throats,</hi> and <hi>cut-purses,</hi> should go before them into the kingdom of heauen. And againe, <hi>Except your righteousnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye cannot</hi>

                  <hi>seeme religious and refraine not his tongue</hi> deceiuing his owne heart, <hi>his religion is in vaine.</hi> And so doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> tell the Iewes that rested in the law, and the outward letter thereof, that their circumcision was no better then vncircumcision; as a man may say to a base player, apparelled like a Kings sonne, that his Princes coat is no better then a beggers. It shall doe him no more good, procure him no more honour or respect. For circumcision, baptisme, hearing, recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing, and all such like badges of outward profession they are but as the outward garment of Christians, which may easily bee put on by those that are none. And therfore howsoeuer thcse by many are thought sufficient to make them good Christians, yet <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> sticks not to make them the <hi>marks of fools,</hi> when there are no better then they, as when hee calleth Gods owne sacrifices, the <hi>sacrifices of fooles, bee more ready to heare then to offer the sacrifice of fools,</hi> because <note place="margin">Eccles. 5.</note> of this foolish conceit which many ground vpon them. but notably doth God shake these <hi>deceiuers</hi> in the fiftieth Psalme, who for all their lying, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, whoring, theeuing, would yet needs goe for Saints, because they were diligent in the outward seruice of the temple. They thought they were very carefull rememberers of God, when they plied him so fast with the sacrifices of the Law, both morning and euening: and yet God telleth them that none were so vnmindfull of him as they, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearefully thundreth against them: <hi>O consider this ye that forget God, least I teare you in peeces:</hi> For when the trueth of Obedience, and power of godlinesse is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19272:40"/> wanting, surely there is small difference betwixt an <hi>Israelite,</hi> and an <hi>Ismaelite,</hi> a circumcised <hi>Hebrewe,</hi> and an vncircumcised <hi>Philistim,</hi> a baptised <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and an vnwashen <hi>Turke.</hi> Neither is the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren <hi>fig-tree</hi> in Gods orchyard in any better case, then is the <hi>bramble</hi> in the wildernesse.

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> besides his outward formal Church-seruice, vrgeth his <hi>faith</hi> in the merits of <hi>Christ</hi>

                  <hi>by hearing,</hi> and so also is it nourished by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, prayer and the sacraments. But these men cannot tell how they came by their faith.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19272:41"/> And it is suspitious when men haue goods, and cannot tel how they came by them: assuredly they cannot say they came to their faith by any such meanes: for they despise the powerfull ministerie, and to pray aright they know not, whereas true faith the daughter of the word, cannot but with al humility and thankfulnes acknowledge her father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True faith is <hi>copulatiue,</hi> it ioyneth together the whole worde of God: it beleeueth one promise as well as another, the promises of this life, as well as those of the life to come. But our <hi>Libertines</hi> faith that seemeth very strong in beleeuing saluation by <hi>Christ,</hi> in temporall dangers, that concerne the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man onely, cannot vphold it selfe: the reason is, for that, as their faith is a fancy it selfe, so it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth eternall saluation as a fancie, and so there can bee bold enough, but <hi>temporall saluation</hi> beeing apprehended as a matter of trueth, their fantasticall faith cannot lay hold of the promises thereof: these men that so confidently professe, that they beleeue God hath prouided superabundant riches of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heereafter for them, cannot yet beleeue that hee will prouide competent necessaries of maintenance for this present life: whence they so tremble in their dangers. Againe faith beleeueth the threats of the word together with the promises: now thou who pretendest beleefe of the promises, shew me thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the threatnings: diddest thou beleeue the truth of those menaces, which God hath denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against vncleane, couetous, ambitious, proud, enuious, malitious persons, and such like sinners, how durst thou then so wallow in these sinnes, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19272:41"/> if God in stead of hell, had promised heauen, as a reward vnto them, thou couldest not doe more, then thou doest; Why shouldest thou deceiue thy selfe with an opinion of faith, when indeede thou beleeuest not so much as the Diuell? for hee <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues</hi> [namely the threatenings of the word] and <hi>trembles</hi> for horrour; but thou goest on in sin, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a mocke of the menaces, and in the infidelity <note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> of thy heart giuest them the lye, saying no such thing shall befall thee.

                  <hi>deceiuers,</hi> the <hi>temporarie beleeuer,</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Temporaries Deceit, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Mat. 13.</note> by our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the <hi>parable</hi> of the stony and thorny ground, and by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Heb, 6. They heare the word, and are inlightened in their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, yea rauished, one would thinke, in their affections: for they heare it saith our Sauiour <hi>with ioy:</hi> where by one of the cheefest affections, wee are by like proportion to vnderstand all the rest, euen the affection of greefe it selfe; that as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in hearing of the comforts, and such like do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which requireth ioy, so when the nature of <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20. explained.</note> doctrine requireth griefe, they are also affected with sorrow, and therefore at the hearing of the word, with those <hi>Israelites,</hi> do often euen draw buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19272:42"/> of water and shed riuers of teares. Euen this a so is to be vnderstood by their hearing the word with ioy, because they reioice euen in this griefe, tasting of the sweetnesse of the word, &amp; finding a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table relish therein. These men we see go very far, so that, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh, they are in some sort, <hi>made partakers of the holy Ghost,</hi> they <hi>taste of the powers of the world to come,</hi> &amp; expresse their inward grace by outward obedience, bringing forth fruit very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, far sooner than others, as the stonie ground is more quicke &amp; forward than other soiles. And yet for all this these also, being rotten at the heart, are to be ranked in the number of <hi>selfe-deceiuers,</hi> as falsely iudging themselues to be in the state of grace. The deceitful argument wherby they thus iudge, is this.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer hath true <hi>faith, repentance, obedience,</hi> is in the state of grace.</p>
               <p>But I haue these three, saith the <hi>Temporary:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am in the state of grace.</p>
               <p>This deceit is far more deep and dangerous, then any of the former three: for their error was in the <hi>ground,</hi> whereon their argumēt was built, not in the application thereof, as in the argument of the <hi>rich worldling; Whosoeuer hath outward prosperitie is in Gods fauour. But I haue outward prosperitie.</hi> Heere the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is in the <hi>proposition,</hi> not in the <hi>assumption:</hi> for he truely <hi>assumes</hi> to himselfe outward prosperitie; but his <hi>proposition</hi> is false, that <hi>Outward prosperitie is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Gods fauour.</hi> So the <hi>Ciuil man</hi> erres not in his <hi>application</hi> of ciuill and outward righteousnesse to himselfe; but in his <hi>ground,</hi> that this ciuill righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is enough to get saluation. And so the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19272:42"/>
                  <hi>loose Protestant</hi> rightly applies to himselfe outward profession, hearing of the word &amp;c. but his ground is deceitfull, that this is sufficient to make one a good <hi>Christian.</hi> But heere it is otherwise. The ground of the temporarie beleeuers argument is most certaine and agreeable to the word, namely, that whosoeuer hath true faith, repentance and obedience is in the state of grace; all the deceit is in the application: for the <hi>Temporarie,</hi> when he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes</hi> those things to himselfe, <hi>presumes.</hi> His <hi>assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But I haue true faith &amp;c is nothing but meere <hi>presumption.</hi> And therefore he is harder to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from this his deceit, than the other: for with them their needed no more adoe, than to shew the falsenesse of their <hi>grounds,</hi> which might easily bee done; but heere the falsenesse of the <hi>application</hi> of their <hi>grounds</hi> must be discouered; which is very hard, because of the neere affinitie and likenesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the faith, repentance, obedience of the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>temporarie</hi> beleeuer: which is so great, that euen the most judicious, and discerning Christians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perfectly distinguish betwixt them. Hence <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> among the disciples, and <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the <hi>Deacon,</hi> among them in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, till God detected them, went for true beleeuers: for this difference of these two faiths howsoeuer in <hi>generall</hi> we know it, as it is reuealed in the word; yet in <hi>speciall</hi> wee know it not, as it is in men, that wee can say, before the <hi>euent</hi> declare it, <hi>This man is a Temporarie only.</hi> This is discernible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, that is <hi>greater then our hearts,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knoweth our hearts better then our selues.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19272:43"/> Neuerthelesse the <hi>Temporarie,</hi> if he would deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially in the trying of his owne heart, by the rule of the word, hee should easily come to espie out the deceit thereof.</p>
               <p>And first as touching his faith, it is euident it is <note place="margin">1. His faith both the</note> not sound: for <hi>Christ</hi> dare not trust it; as wee see in them that are said in the Gospel to beleeue in <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet could not be beleeued by him. <hi>Many</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 23. 24.</note>
                  <hi>Iohn) beleeued in his name when they saw his myracles, but Iesus did not commit himselfe vnto them, because hee knew them all.</hi> But of the true beleeuer <hi>Christ</hi> saies, <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 64.</note> that hee reiects none that comes vnto him. <hi>Iudas</hi> was an <hi>arch-temporarie,</hi> and yet, that he neuer true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued, appeareth by the same <hi>Euangelist</hi> thus commenting vpon those words of Christ <hi>[But there are some of you that beleeue not] for Iesus knew who they were that beleeued not, and who should betray him.</hi> Marke how the Euangelist rankes the <hi>traytour</hi> among the <hi>non-beleeuers;</hi> and how, being to giue a reason why <hi>Christ</hi> said all of them beleeued not, he saith <hi>Christ</hi> knew who should betray him. And more plainly doth this appeare afterward in <hi>Christs</hi> answere to <note place="margin">Ver. 70.</note>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> professing in the name of the whole twelue, <hi>Wee beleeue</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a Deuill?</hi> As if he should say, no <hi>Peter,</hi> al of you doe not beleeue, though thou speakest generally of all. One of you is a <hi>Deuill.</hi> Let vs see then how this <hi>temporarie</hi> deceiueth himselfe, in thinking hee hath that faith which hee wants. The deceitfull argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby he would conclude faith to himselfe is drawen, first from the <hi>partes</hi> of faith: secondly the <hi>signes.</hi> The <hi>parts</hi> of faith are two, first <hi>knowledge</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19272:43"/> of the word in <hi>generall</hi> with assent: secondly <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Parts which are.</note> of the promises in <hi>speciall</hi> to ones selfe. Both these the <hi>temporarie</hi> thinkes hee hath, and therefore also faith. First for <hi>knowledge</hi> it cannot be denied, but he may haue an excellent measure thereof; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as hee may not onely apprehend all the <note place="margin">1 Generall knowledge, which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be deceitfull because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</note> points of Religion himselfe, and be able to talke of them, but also teach them vnto others; as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and many others, whose plea shalbe at the last day, <hi>Lord haue wee not taught in thy name?</hi> And in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the lampes of the <hi>foolish virgins</hi> blaze as much as the wise ones. Yet for all this, there are deceits <note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> in this knowledge whereby it is differenced from the knowledge of true faith.</p>
               <p>First, the knowledge of the <hi>Temporarie</hi> is not so wel grounded either vpon the <hi>testimonie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>

At the same time the beleeuer applies <hi>Christ</hi> to his owne heart, he applies his heart to Christ, and cleaues to him with full purpose of soule. This was notablie shadowed out vnder the ceremoniall law, in the coniunction of the <hi>sinne-offring</hi> which noted <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>burnt-offring</hi> which, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> it, more specially signified the sacrificing of the flesh, the crucifying of <hi>old Adam.</hi> True faith offers both these at once. But the temporaries faith
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19272:46"/> is lame on that hand, which should offer the <hi>burnt offering,</hi> he onely <hi>takes Christ,</hi> hee giues not himselfe to <hi>Christ:</hi> hee offers the <hi>sinne offering</hi> without the <hi>burnt offering.</hi> And therefore applying <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>himselfe,</hi> and not <hi>himselfe</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> hee misapplieth. Indeed hee may make some shew of giuing himselfe to <hi>Christ,</hi> but in trueth hee reserues himselfe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee nourishes some speciall sinne or other in himselfe, and so giues himselfe to Sathan, to sin, not to <hi>Christ.</hi> As <hi>Herod</hi> gaue himselfe not to <hi>Christ,</hi> but to <hi>Herodias,</hi> to his lust; &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> gaue himselfe not to <hi>Christ,</hi> but to the bagge, and to the baggage of his couetousnes.</p>

                  <hi>things that are not,</hi> much more thē of things which indeed are, though not in appearance: If it can giue subsistence to things that are not subsistent, much more then apparance, and uisibility, to things that are not visible &amp; apparant: so that faith can see one contrary in another, in the very depth of hell, hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, in the very extremity of misery, happinesse, in the very middest of anger, mercy: and the Woman of Canaan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. can picke comfort out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull name of dogge: and when nothing but war to be seene in Gods face, yet then can it pierce through all the thicke clouds, and behold the sweet sunshine of Gods fauor and grace in Christ: through
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19272:47"/> the bent browes of the irefull iudge can it see the earning and relenting bowels of the compassionate Father: the eye of true faith can looke vpon God not onely <hi>smiling,</hi> and inuiting vs to himselfe by a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>gratious,</hi> but also <hi>lowring,</hi> and driuing vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a darke and cloudy countenance: but then is our <hi>temporaries</hi> faith cleane dashed out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. <hi>will the hypocrite pray alwaies?</hi> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> and <note place="margin">Iob. 27. 10.</note> so, will he beleeue alway? No, a little wind blowes downe the spiders webbe of his hope: When Gods hands are full of gifts to bestow, then his faith is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lay hold on them. Hee is like to children that come running to their Father when there is an apple in his hand to tolle them, but not when the rod is in his hand to correct them: or rather like to dogges, which if they see a crust in your hand, come fawning and glauering; but if they see a cudgell, and that you come toward them to strike, either they fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runne away, or desperately flye in your face. But the true beleeuer goes further, and when there is a naked drawne sword in Gods hands, yet hee dares venter and presse towards God: though the Lorde set neuer so sterne a countenance against him, hee will not bee outfaced, but in a holy kinde of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency hee will outlooke him, and say, Lord though thou looke vpon mee as though thou wouldest slay me, yet still will I looke vnto thee for helpe, <hi>though thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee:</hi> But in such a case the <hi>temporaries</hi> former <hi>iolly confidence</hi> vanisheth, <note place="margin">Iob. 13.</note> heere is the triall of faith.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>temporary</hi> deceiues himselfe in the <hi>parts</hi> of Faith. The <hi>signes</hi> of faith are those <hi>feelings,</hi> those

If his ioy in the word had beene sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he would haue reioyced as well in the doctrine of the seuenth commandement, as in any other: but this galled him. Thus is it with our temporary, hee can delight in the worde, as long as it troubles him not in his beloued sinnes: but let it once touch him there, he spurns presently, and flings away.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19272:50"/> by withdrawing our necks from his yoake: we haue an example in the <hi>Apostaticall</hi> Church of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, conceiuing a purpose of returning againe to the Lord, for that it was better with her before, then <note place="margin">Hos. 2, 7.</note> since her reuolt. And so the <hi>prodigall sonne,</hi> when he was pinched with famine, calling to minde the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer goodfare at his Fathers house, resolueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to returne home againe. hence it was that Christ going about to recouer the Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus something fallen, hee puts her in mind of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer estate, and the happy priuiledges therof which now shee wanted; <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, &amp;c.</hi> that is, consider what kinde of estate thou wast in, in the time of thy first loue, how full of peace, ioy in the holy Ghost, liberty of spirit, &amp;c. and then, repentance and doing the first workes will follow: for he that hath once tasted of the sweet of his ioy, is so affected therewith, that with <hi>Paul</hi> he would rather dye, then loose it. And therefore, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Luke 15.

But now it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with the base counterfeit ioy of the <hi>temporarie</hi> beleeuer: the true beleeuers ioy ariseth from a through apprehension of Gods mercy by faith, from a through feeling of the warmth of the <hi>Euangelicall wine,</hi> cheering him euen at the very heart, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ioy obtained the chiefety and soueraignty in his soule, for the ioy in outward things was but as a shadow, and in them as before was said, hee reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>as though he reioyced not.</hi> Hence then it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that sinne hauing prophaned &amp; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19272:51"/> obscured his ioy, notwithstanding al outward comforts in great variety, &amp; abundance present thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, &amp; their seruice, yet they are in his accoūt, but miserable comforters no for all them he droupes, &amp; hangs downe the head, and <hi>hangs vp his harps,</hi> remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the <hi>comforts of Sion,</hi> &amp; those sweet <hi>songs of the night,</hi> wherwith God was once wōt to fil his mouth, <note place="margin">Psalm, 137.

O the sweet songs of the night, &amp; heauenly inspirations of the almighty! O the gracious visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the spirit, &amp; teachings of the reins in the night seasō! How was I then fed with the bread of Angels, &amp; feasted with the daintiest of those heauenly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates? Why then do I depriue my selfe of al these cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts by mine owne negligence? Why returne I not againe to my good God, to enioy his heretofore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted sweetnes? But now the <hi>tēporaries</hi> ioy ariseth only from a very slight &amp; superficiall apprehension of the promises, only frō a sipping of this wine in the mouth &amp; not frō any operation therof at the hart: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ioy, as wee shewed was greater in outward things thē in spiritual: &amp; hence it comes to passe that when for the retaining of these temporall comforts hee begins to fall, his spirituall ioy, by this meanes once interrupted, quite dieth: for it was not of that force, to leaue so deepe an impression in his heart as that afterward he should be affected with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof in so powerfull a manner, as thereby to be raised vp againe, to seeke the Lorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh by a renued act of faith, and repentance. But the ioy and comfort of the true beleeuer had such a

The ioy of true faith is a more orderly, and leysurely ioy, it comes not comes not all on the sudden, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually <note place="margin">4 Vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hastinesse.</note> by certaine steppes and degrees, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. First the beleeuer sees his owne sinfull wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, cleerely represented to his eies in the glasse of the Law, and thereupon, agast with so fearefull a sight, he is in great distresse, feeling how bitter, and burdensome his sinnes are for which being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pricked and perplexed in conscience, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no remedy but faith in Christ, he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to hunger for Christs righteousnesse, and for faith to apprehend it, yawning in his desires, euen like the dry and thirsty ground. This faith when at length hee hath got by many strong and loud cries sent vp to the throne of Grace, he feeleth his minde calmed, and beginneth to reioyce in the saluation of the Lord. An example of ioy thus wrought wee haue in those conuerts of <hi>Peter,</hi> who were first prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wounded in spirit, crying out to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37. 38. 46.</note> for some reliefe, and then afterward, hearing the promises and receiuing the sacraments, they were replenished with the ioy of the holy Ghost But the <hi>temporaries</hi> ioy comes not on so slowly, but it sprouteth forth, like <hi>Ionas</hi> gourde, suddenly in one night.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ouer violent hastinesse, that is in our <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries</hi> ioy, and so also other of his graces, giueth vs iust cause to suspect them as deceitfull, and to feare in them the truth of the common prouerbe, <hi>Soone ripe, soone rotten.</hi> As in trauailers, he that at the first is so free and frolike, and spurres it, and gallops it so lustily, hee ouertakes indeede many in the way, and leaues them behind, but at length his horse is tyred, and then he is ouertaken to his shame, of the more sober and moderate rider, whom erewhile he passed by, as an ouerslow cōpanion: so in this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al iourney our <hi>Sauiour</hi> noteth it, that <hi>many of the first</hi> that outstript their fellows, <hi>shall be last,</hi> when the last shall be first.

The flattering of the Sunne raies often drawes forth the blossomes very early: but afterward come cold nippes, and then al is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and it had bin better they had not beene so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: It is good then for Christians, that would not deceiue themselues, to take heede of the stony grounds ouerforwardnes: in their first beginnings to be wisely moderate: when they are but children in

Where it cannot be denied, but that he may go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre in the probable resemblance of repentance; insomuch as he himselfe, as wel as others, may think hee hath in truth repented: To examine this more particularly, in the particulars of repentance, and first in that which is inward, and then in that which <note place="margin">1 Inward, in his</note> is outward therein;</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>inward practise of repentance,</hi> there are two speciall things wherein hee deceiues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Sorrow, Desire.</hi> The former respecting time past: the latter time present and to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For his <hi>sorrow,</hi> he is wondrous wide: hee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <note place="margin">1 Sorrow</note> no doubt, oftentimes some remorse, the prickes and stings of an accusing conscience, as it were the arrowes of the almighty sticking in his ribbes: and hereupon concludes hee hath his part in godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But exceeding falsely, and deceitfully: For who feele greater gripes, and pangs of vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <note place="margin">proued false.</note> and vexing consciences then doe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels themselues, and the most desperate repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates? so that if this reason were good, they also should haue godly sorrow. Indeed these compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of heart, these horrors, and terrors in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19272:54"/> are a notable <hi>preparatiue</hi> to godly sorrow; and they are as the prickes of the needle making way for the thred: as we may see in the example of that troupe of Saint Peters conuerts: neuerthelesse they <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> are to be distinguished from <hi>repentance</hi> it selfe, as being common to the reprobate, with the elect. Therefore as the sicke patient should deciue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in thinking he had taken a sufficient purge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath taken a <hi>preparatiue;</hi> or as hee should deceiue himselfe, that should thinke hee were ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red farre enough into the house, that standes only in the <hi>entry,</hi> in the <hi>porch:</hi> so doth here our <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> delude his soule, mistaking some <hi>preparatory,</hi> and <hi>introductorie</hi> workes vnto repentance for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it selfe, For notwithstanding those <hi>penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi> in the <hi>Actes</hi> were miserablie wracked, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in conscience, &amp; felt the two edged sword of the spirit piercing through their soules, yet when they demaunded of <hi>Peter</hi> what they should doe, namely to be eased of their present distresse, recei-this answer, <hi>Repent;</hi> belike then they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented <note place="margin">

Nay marke how <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes <hi>repentance</hi> as the only soueraigne remedie to releeue them in that their agonie. Loe then yet a fouler and grosser deceit, to take the <hi>disease</hi> for the <hi>remedie,</hi> to think that because they haue the wound cureable only by the <hi>balme of Gilead,</hi> therefore they haue the balme it selfe.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19272:54"/> with the sense of sin, and yet (as yet) not come to <hi>Christ.</hi> Yea there is as great difference betwixt being thus heauie loaden &amp; comming to <hi>Christ,</hi> as betwixt hauing a burthen on ones backe &amp; the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it taken off: for therfore doth <hi>Christ</hi> cal such to come vnto him, that by this meanes they might be eased. And yet more plainely doth our Sauiour cleare this, when he saith that he came <hi>to call sinners</hi> (vnderstand it of sinners laden with the burthen of their sins, seeing and bewailing their miserie) <hi>to Repentance.</hi> Therefore to feele ones selfe a sinner, &amp; to be touched with the sense of our misery, is not alwaies Repentance. And in the place forealleaged <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 28. hee bids such as are laden with sinne, that is, such as feele the smart of sins guilt pressing the conscience, euen these he bids to learne humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: which shewes that a man may be affected with some sense of sinne, and yet not truly humbled in godly sorrow. But that his deceit, in thinking <note place="margin">Mat. 9. And discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the marks of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow.</note> he hath godly sorrow, may the better appeare, let vs briefely examine it by the <hi>properties</hi> of <hi>godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Godly sorrow</hi> respects the <hi>sinne</hi> more than <note place="margin">which are 1. To respect the sinne most</note> the <hi>punishment,</hi> and maketh the repenting sinner to be of this minde, that hee care not what outward punishment he indured, so that he might feele the guilt of his sinne washed out of his conscience, and behold the louing countenance of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi> The voice of godly sorrow is that of <hi>Dauid, Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the</hi> trespasse of thy seruant. It is the <hi>trespasse</hi> he <note place="margin">2. Sam, 24.</note> would haue taken away: for as for the <hi>punishment,</hi> how hee stood affected, let his owne words after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19272:55"/> witnesse, when he speakes thus to <hi>God, let thine hand be vpon mee and my fathers house.</hi> But it is only the punishment either felt, or feared that causeth that howling and crying, which sometimes is in the wicked <hi>temporarie,</hi> as in <hi>Esau, Ahab, Iudas &amp;c.</hi> The voice of this base sorrow is that of <hi>Pharaoh, take away this plague,</hi> namely of the outward scourge, not, <hi>take away this hard heart,</hi> a greater plague then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea then all the ten plagues. Marke the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Pharoh</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> the <hi>slaues</hi> griefe, which is for the whip, and the <hi>sonnes,</hi> which is for offending his kind and louing father. The one is the griefe of <hi>loue,</hi> the other of <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Godly sorrow</hi> is <hi>lasting</hi> and durable. <hi>My</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Psal. 51. 3.</note>
                  <hi>sinne,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid, is euer before me.</hi> Their humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a continuall act, renewed daily; insomuch that, if they sometime through weakenesse omit it, they recompense it with an extraordinary measure thereof afterward. The <hi>Prophet</hi> elsewhere complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that his <hi>teares</hi> weare as his <hi>ordinarie food,</hi> which <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 3.</note> if men omit one day, they eate the more for it the next. But the sorrow of these <hi>temporaries</hi> is <hi>agueish,</hi> and comes only by <hi>fittes</hi> and startes. Yet heerein not agueish, that agues are constant in their fittes, and some of them hold long: these sorrowes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vncertain and momentanie. They may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as a graue diuine speaketh, <hi>sermon-sick,</hi> but no otherwise, then men are <hi>sea-sick,</hi> who are presently well againe, when they come to shoare. Heere then is the deceit of the <hi>temporarie,</hi> that thinkes he hath sorrowed enough, if that at any time he feele any <hi>panges</hi> of these passions, any <hi>qualmes</hi> of griefe, any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19272:55"/> smal workings of sorrow to disquiet him but a litle. A like, as if one, feeling the flesh to smart, after the playster newly applied to the soare, should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take off the playster, and thinke it had wrought enough; whereas the playster must ly on still, till it haue eate out the corruption wholy. And so must this corrosiue of godlie sorrow, applied once to the festered sores of our sinnes still remaine with vs till they be throughly healed, that is to our dying day; and then <hi>all teares,</hi> euen the teares of godly sorrow it selfe, <hi>shall be wiped away, but not before.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel, 7, 17. 3 Driuing to God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, godly sorrow, yea the very first seedes, and preparations thereof, those terrours, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that are in the consciences of the elect, they still driue them to God, and fit them for the hand of God, to be wrought and framed thereby. As wee may see in them whom <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon pricked. Their wound made them seeke for physicke, and draue them to the Physition, to the men and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God. Now <hi>Iudas</hi> also had his terrours of conscience. So also had <hi>Saul</hi> his. But whether did they driue them? The former not to Christ, but to the enemies of Christ, the high Priests, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to whom he went, when he went to the halter. The latter also, not to praier, not to God, not to the men of God, but to musick, to the harpe, and at the last to the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> to the Diuell. So they draue <hi>Cain</hi> to the building of Cities, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Gen, 4, 17.</note> to deceiue those terrors by that imployment of his minde. Thus alwaies doth the <hi>temporarie,</hi> when God shootes this arrowe into the side of his conscience, fly from him, as a dogge from him that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19272:56"/> striketh him with a cudgell, and seekes any where rather for reliefe than at his hands: for such is his despaire whereof he is swallowed vp, and such is his desperate malice &amp; hatred against God in this case, that he cannot so much as whisper the least syllable to him. It is otherwise with the elect of God. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> being fearefully wounded and confounded in his minde, could yet then say to that God that did all that vnto him, <hi>Lord what wouldest thou haue mee to doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Godly sorrow <hi>worketh repentance,</hi> a <note place="margin">4 To renew vs. 2. Cor 7. 10.</note> change and alteration of heart, causing vs to hate sinne and loue righteousnesse. And the reason is, for that in godly sorrow the heart is moulten and wholly liquefied and dissolued, and so being made soft and tender, receiueth the stamp and impresse of Gods spirit. But in these our <hi>Temporaries</hi> no such matter. They may other while shead a few <hi>whorish</hi> teares, and <hi>hang downe the head like a bulrush for a daie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay 58. 5.</note> with those <hi>Iewes:</hi> but filthie swine that they are, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue washed themselues (in the waters, one would haue thought, of repentance) they returne presently to their wallowing in the mire of their former filthinesse. <hi>Ahab</hi> fastes, and pinches his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case <note place="margin">1. Kings 21. 27</note> with sack-cloath, and goes creeping and crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; but had he euer truely repented for oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of poore <hi>Naboth,</hi> would he so soone after haue fallen into the same sinne of oppression, in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust imprisonment of the holy Prophet <hi>Micaiah?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings 23. 26</note> Where the circumstance of the person oppressed addeth weight to the sinne. If it had beene true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, his <hi>hand</hi> would not still haue remained
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19272:56"/>
                  <hi>bloudie,</hi> nor his eare <hi>vncircumcised,</hi> to distast the wholesome Prophecies of faithfull <hi>Micaiah. Esau,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 34. 36.</note> in the midest of his yelling, falsely accuseth <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob</hi> his brother for cosenage, seeketh to haue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing seuered from his brothers, and carrieth a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiue minde against him, purposing to murther him. Yea <hi>Foelix,</hi> when stroken with the maiestie of <note place="margin">Acts 24. 26. 27</note> the word in <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth, so that he trembled again for feare, yet euen then he remained the same coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>Felix</hi> that before: at that very instant he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, hee coueted, and expected a bribe of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he gaue <hi>Paul</hi> some occasion, to expect repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him. Thus also when Gods threatnings in the ministerie of <hi>Moses</hi> wrung <hi>teares</hi> out of the <note place="margin">Num. 14. 39. 40. Deut. 1. 40. 41.</note> Israelites <hi>eies;</hi> yet they could not wring <hi>rebellion</hi> out of their <hi>hearts:</hi> for being threatned to die in the wildernesse for their thoughts of returning into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and therefore commanded not to go the next way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to back againe into the desert, that so the denounced sentence might be executed; they seemed much to be moued herewith, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues in weeping and confession of their sinnes: but yet for all this, they would by no means be perswaded to obey the commandement of not going on strayt foreward toward <hi>Canaan.</hi> The like is to be thought of <hi>Iudas</hi> his griefe: for all that, still he remained the same old <hi>Iudas</hi> that before. There was not any true hatred of his sinne wrought in his heart; for then he would not haue added murther to murther. Nay, if he had liued, he would haue bin readie to haue played some such new pranke. Thus is it with all <hi>temporaries.</hi> Though they shead riuers
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19272:57"/> of teares, though they <hi>water their couches,</hi> and euen <hi>bathe,</hi> and <hi>soake</hi> themselues in this salt brine, yet for all this they remaine vnseasoned and vnmortified. Their <hi>leopards spottes</hi> still remaine vnwashen, their <hi>blackamores hide</hi> vnchanged. But godly sorrowe is of that nature, that the soule, once drenched, and <note place="margin">In the elect.</note> baptized with the teares thereof, receiueth such a <hi>tincture,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> of grace, that will neuer after out. There is no distillation of herbes so pretious for the curing of bodily, as this of godlie sorrowes teares for the healing our soules infirmities. The aire is not so cleared, when the cloud is dissolued by raine, as the minde when the cloudes of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are dissolued by the raine of repenting teares, These waters are the red sea, wherein the whole armie of our sins is drowned. But for that these waters in the <hi>temporarie</hi> are but shallow, and want their iust depth, therefore his sinnes are not <hi>choaked,</hi> but rather deliciously <hi>bathed</hi> therein. And so much for the temporaries sorrow.</p>
               <p>His desires are noe lesse deceitfull. <hi>Desire</hi> is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">2. Desires, discouered. 2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> by <hi>Paul</hi> among the fruites, or partes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And in <hi>temporaries</hi> there seeme oft times to be good motions, dispositions, and desires after good things. They in the Gospell, hearing the excellent discourse of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> concerning the heauenly <hi>Manna,</hi> cried out, as affected therewith, <hi>Lord euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note>
                  <hi>giue vs of this bread.</hi> And <hi>Agrippa</hi> was so farre wrought vpon by <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee said, <hi>Thou almost persuadest me to become a Christian.</hi> But these desires <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> of the temporarie are not sound. For</p>
               <p n="1">1 True desires are no <hi>faint</hi> desires, but such as <note place="margin">By their 1. faintnesse.</note>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:19272:57"/> make vs faint, they are so eager and earnest; like the desires of couetous men, who with <hi>Ahab</hi> will bee sick for their neighbours vineyard, they long for it so desirously. And therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>Couet</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor, 14, 1.</note> after spirituall things; yea like the desire of <hi>Rabel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter children, which made her say, <hi>Giue mee children</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal, 43, 1.</note>
                  <hi>or I dye.</hi> See it in <hi>Dauid, Like as the heart braieth after the riuers of water, so doth my soule after thee O God.</hi> And gaine, <hi>My soule desireth after thee like the thirsty</hi>

                  <hi>Iam sicke of loue,</hi> nor as <hi>Sisera</hi> in his naturall thirst, <hi>I dye for thirst, giue me drinke:</hi> for this is the nature of strong and feruent desires, to bee so impatient of delay, that they commonly verifie <hi>Salomons</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <note place="margin">Pro, 13, 12.</note>
                  <hi>The hope that is deferred is the fainting of the soule.</hi> Therefore our Sauiour blesseth indeed those <note place="margin">Math, 5. 4. 6.</note> that hunger, and thirst for his righteousnesse, but yet such as hunger and thirst <hi>in mourning,</hi> which was that he required before vnto blessednesse: the blessed desires then are onely those, which are so <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate,</hi> that they make the desirer to mourn, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his desire not to bee fulfilled: but now our <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,</hi> though he desire grace, yet he feeles no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty greefe in the want of grace, this neuer troubles him, it neuer breakes his sleepe. Therefore his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are not right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True desires of good things are exceeding <note place="margin">2. Lazinesse.</note> painfull and laborious, in auoiding all hinderances, and in vsing all good helpes, and furtherances. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> thirst made him venter the liues of his three worthies.

               <p n="1">1. True confession must come, as wee see in the Publicane, from a touched and troubled soule, from that broken and bleeding heart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> from that melting, and relenting heart of <hi>Iosiah:</hi> This is the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which the Lord will not despise.</hi> But our <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> knowes it not, The paine off the wracke onely wrings the confession from him, not the mercy of that sweet God, whom he hath offended.

This the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his distresse cannot do. <hi>Iudas</hi> could say, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi> but for his life he could not adde those words of <hi>Dauid, Take away the sinne of thy seruant.</hi> Nay hee could not say that confession, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but only to the high Priests: for he was wholly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of despaire. His repentance was a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate repentance, not tempered with faith, so as is the true repentance. And therefore our Sauiour prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching repentance saith, <hi>Repent and beleeue.</hi>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:19272:60"/> 3. Confession must come from an honest heart, <note place="margin">3 nor an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest heart.</note> purposing not to sinne, that so with the confession we may ioyne also the confusion and ouerthrow of sinne: <hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh</hi> (that is, hee that in that very act of confessing forsaketh) <hi>his sin, shall find mercy.</hi> This was the confession of that good <note place="margin">Prou, 28, 13.</note>

Now therefore let vs make a couenant with the Lord, to put away all the wiues.</hi> But how farre are the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from this, who when by confession they haue seemed to disgorge their stomacks, haue filthily with the dogge eaten vp their owne vomit againe? And so farre are they from this purpose of not sinning, that they are fully set vpon sinne, in confessing; as in those <hi>Israelites,</hi> that said, <hi>we haue sinned, we will go vp:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut, 1, 41.</note> which was as much as if they should haue said, <hi>we haue sinned, we will sinne:</hi> for God in the former verse <note place="margin">vers. 40.</note> had forbidden them to goe vp: yea many of them presume to sinne, because of confession, thinking by it to be eased, as the drunkard by his vomiting: And though some of them in their good moodes, and in some of their fits may seeme, when they humble themselues in confession, verily to purpose amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet these are no sound, no setled, no sincere &amp; honest purposes, but sudden flashings, conceiued by their deceitfull hearts, rather to auoide the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments either felt, or feared, then truely to please God; and thus because the heart is not rent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the garments, therefore neither is the sin rent, but rather sown faster together by that rending of the garment, and because with that penitent <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane,</hi> they ioyne not the <hi>inward vniting</hi> of the <hi>hart,</hi>

For,</p>
               <p>First, though he may pray to our thinking (and his <note place="margin">1 Not in more grieuous trials Iob 27. 10.</note> owne too sometime) very feruently, yet as <hi>Iob</hi> saies, <hi>wil he pray alwaie?</hi> no, in more grieuous trialls his heart, and hope fails him, his mouth is stopt, he is strooke speechles with the ghuest in the parable, and hath not so much as one word, to blesse himself with all, who yet lauished most luxuriously in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of wordes in the time of peace.</p>

Rom, 9, 3.</note> but with <hi>selfe-respects,</hi> and those very base; as may easily appeare by these two things: 1. his praiers are more zealous and feruent with others, then alone by <note place="margin">Ille dolet verè qui sine teste dolet.</note> himselfe: whereas the vehemency of a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is then greatest, when hee is shut vp in his closet, and hath God only to be witnesse of it. This shewes, that pride and vaineglory sway him, not any true zeale to Gods glory: 2▪ after praier hee hath no care to returne thanks: as in the nine leapers which cried, as loud as the tenth, <hi>Iesus haue mercy,</hi> but returned <note place="margin">Luc. 17, 13, 15</note> not with him to giue thanks for their health; which shewed they sought themselues onely in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and nothing esteemed the loue of <hi>Christ.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3.

And that which <hi>Salomon</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of other idle talke, will be true of the vain prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of such slothfull praiers, <hi>In all labour there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:</hi>

Such kinde of minds haue the vnregenerate in their praiers, still they loue their sinnes, and would not for all their talke, leaue them by their good wils. And therefore doe they so neere resemble him in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when his cart stucke in the mire, called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his God for helpe, but yet lay still, and would not stir the least of his fingers to help himselfe; yea and

But yet this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deceitful or else the vncleane spirit could not so easily reenter <hi>with seuen worse spirits than himselfe</hi> into the party thus reformed, so that <hi>his latter end</hi>

A theefe when he is manacled, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not steale, he absteines outwardly: and yet happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath a theeuish minde still. And a chained Lyon though hee absteine from deuouring, yet he hath his lionish nature still; he hath not left that. Many leaue their sinnes in like manner being restrained by feare, shame, and such like respects. Their hearts still delight, and tickle themselues in the thoughts of those sinnes. But true reformation of sinne must
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19272:63"/> proceede from the hatred of sinne, and from the loue of Gods law forbidding sinne, as <hi>Dauids</hi> did. <hi>I haue refrained,</hi> saith he, <hi>from euery euill way;</hi> but why <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 101.</note> did he so? vpon what ground? to what end? <hi>that I might keepe thy word.</hi> It was that loue of the law which he had so pathetically a little before profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Oh! how loue I thy law?</hi> this was it that made him to refraine from sinne, his affection toward the word; and this was that he propounded to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in absteining from sinne, in displeasing his owne corruption to please the law, to obey the law. <hi>The wolfe,</hi> saith <hi>Austen, comes</hi> to the sheepe-fold, <note place="margin">

They hated those good commandements of the Lord, that forbade those sinnes, and could haue wished with all their hearts there had beene no such commandements: which shewed that euen in those commandements they kept, as <hi>Herod</hi> in hearing <hi>Iohn, Iudas Christ,</hi> their obedience was rotten and vnsound, and with out all regard of Gods commandement: for the same God, that bade <hi>Herod</hi> reuerence <hi>Iohns</hi> ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the second commandement, bade him also <hi>possesse his vessel in holinesse and honour,</hi> in the seuenth.

So <hi>Iudas</hi> if he had truely hated other sinnes, because they were sinnes, he could not then haue loued, and so liued in couetousnesse. And if Gods feare had made <hi>Iehu</hi> put downe <hi>Baals</hi> worship, he would not then haue still reteined <hi>Ieroboams calues,</hi> the same God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both. Let the <hi>temporarie</hi> then marke himselfe well, and he shall finde that in some point or other he hath a <hi>dispensatorie</hi> conscience with Gods word. And as rogues vnder hedges without the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, so he can make licenses to himselfe without Gods warrant, to continue in his or that sinne. Whereby his prophane contempt of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly bewrayed, and his obedience in other things conuinced to be no obedience to God, but to man, or to himselfe, or to that respect, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is, that drew it forth.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19272:69"/> he that suffereth aright, must suffer in denial of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his owne carnall affections, according to our <hi>Sauiours</hi> direction giuen to all such, whom he calleth to be his disciples. <hi>If any man,</hi> saith he, <hi>will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 16. 24.</note>
                  <hi>be my Disciple, he must denie himselfe, and take vp the crosse.</hi> It is not enough simplie to take vp the crosse, but first he must denie himselfe, and so take vp the crosse. But the temporarie seekes himselfe in taking vp the crosse. They are his owne proude, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, vaineglorious, couetous affections that make him stoupe to take vp the crosse. The fruit of the <hi>thornie</hi> ground is able indeede to beare the heate of the sunne, and is not consumed therewith, as the <hi>stonie</hi> grounds: but whats the reason? because the thornes couering it doe fense off the sunne. And whats the reason our <hi>thornie temporarie</hi> is so ready sometimes to run himselfe into the bryers of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but that the thorne of some wicked lust or other is a <hi>spurre</hi> in his side. Marke the best of the <hi>temporaries</hi> in their sufferings, and you shall see, that for all the thornes of persecution, wherewith the aduersaries prick them, they still continue prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">but yet deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> their owne soules, with the thornes of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, pride and vaine-glory. These thornes pricks them forward to the suffering of the other thornes; as in <hi>Iudas</hi> hee looked one day for a good day, hee hoped to haue no meane place in <hi>Christs</hi> temporall kingdome, and withall in present he felt the sweete of carying the bagge. He carried the <hi>crosse</hi> on his <hi>back,</hi> that he might carry the <hi>bagge</hi> in his <hi>hands,</hi> The delight and comfort he tooke in lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fingers after the receipt of the almes, made
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19272:70"/> him willingly indure the little pain of his back. The bag in the hand was a staffe and prop to vphold his back from sinking vnder the burthen of the Crosse The sweetnesse, not of <hi>Gods loue shead into his heart,</hi> but of <hi>mans loue shead into his hands</hi> was that, which <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> allayed the sowrenes of the crosse. So with others, the coole winde not of <hi>Gods,</hi> but of <hi>mens</hi> praises is that which refresheth them in the skorching of this sunne, and maketh them with some comfort <hi>beare the heate of the day. Though I giue my body to be burned</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>haue not loue, I am nothing.</hi> Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that men may burne their bodies, as he burnt <hi>Dianaes</hi> temple, of selfe-loue, of loue of glory and fame in the world, and not of any true loue to God, or his Church. Let vs not then please our selues ouer much, if wee haue suffered something for the truth, because, euen in suffering, the heart is deceitfull; but search we our owne hearts, and see whether, as the <hi>aduersarie</hi> persecutes the <hi>new man</hi> in vs, so <hi>wee</hi> thence take occasion to persecute the <hi>ould man</hi> in our selues: whether we turne the sword, thrust at vs to kill the life of grace, to the opening of our impostumes: whether, as it were by one nayle driuing out another, wee vse the <hi>thornes</hi> of <hi>persecution,</hi> as meanes and medicines against the <hi>thornes</hi> of <hi>couetousnesse,</hi> and worldlinesse. It is an ill <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 14. Psal. 44. 22. 2. Tim. 2. 10.</note> signe, when we can beare the <hi>worlds yoke</hi> in <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and yet, at the same time, not endure <hi>Gods yoke</hi> in <hi>mortification.</hi> Againe, examine wee the ground, and end of our suffering, whether we can truly say with <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Psalmist, The loue of Christ constrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, for thy sake we are killed,</hi> and <hi>we suffer all thinges</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:19272:70"/>
                  <hi>for the elects sake:</hi> for as we haue shewed, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pride, and vaine-glory setteth many on this worke. And, which is not all out so bad, happily others may be forced by the feare of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, threatned against them, that deny the truth. But then, as God said once to the Iewes in the matter of <hi>fasting, haue yee fasted to mee,</hi> so heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may he say to vs in the matter of <hi>suffering; Haue yee suffered for mee.</hi> And when wee shall begin to tell <hi>Christ</hi> of such kinde of sufferings, and to say with <hi>Peter, Wee haue left all and followed thee,</hi> he may <note place="margin">Math. 19. 27. 28.</note>
                  <hi>twit</hi> vs with the same answere, wherewithall he then pinched <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> included in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his speach, <hi>Whosoeuer shall forsake houses, lands, &amp;c.</hi> for my names sake, <hi>shall receiue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold.</hi> But <hi>Iudas,</hi> and so all other <hi>temporarie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, whatsoeuer they haue suffered for <hi>Christ,</hi> it hath not beene <hi>for his sake,</hi> but for their owne.

               </argument>
               <p>ANd of the second <hi>deceit</hi> of the hart, in iudging <note place="margin">3. Deceit that our good is better then it is.</note> of our persons, so much: The third followeth. And that is, when we iudge our selues to be better, then indeed we are; when our <hi>little</hi> is thought a <hi>great deale,</hi> our <hi>mite</hi> of grace, a <hi>talent,</hi> our <hi>moat,</hi> a <hi>beame,</hi> our <hi>molehill</hi> a <hi>mountain,</hi> our <hi>smoaking flaxe</hi> the <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>blazing flame</hi> of some mighty bonfire, our small beginnings, the height of perfection. Of this deceit the Apostle speaketh, when taxing the pride of the Corinthians, whereby they thought themselues wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, then indeede they were, he thus writeth, <hi>Let no man deceiue himselfe: if any man among you seeme to be wise, let him become a fool, &amp;c.</hi> Shewing that herein is <note place="margin">1, Cor, 3, 18.</note> the <hi>selfe-deceit,</hi> when we are better conceited of our selues, then there is cause. Heerein our deceitfull hearts are like to those kind of glasses, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things many degrees greater then in deed they are. Thus the <hi>Corinthian</hi> teachers looking vpon themselues in this false glasse, magnified themselues aboue S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, whence was that modest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Apostle, <hi>Wee dare not compare our selues with them,</hi> and againe, <hi>yee are full, ye raigne,</hi> &amp;c <note place="margin">2, Cor. 10, 12. 1, Cor, 4, 8.</note> This was the deceit of him that saide, <hi>all these haue I kept from my youth,</hi> and still it is to bee found in too <note place="margin">Math, 19, 20.</note> too many: not onely such as the old <hi>Perfectists,</hi> and now the <hi>Papists:</hi> but euen in the best of vs all, who
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19272:71"/> through selfe-loue, are no lesse affected to our owne graces, then parents to their owne children, whom they vse to account the fairest of all others: hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise those high thoughts, and strong conceits of our owne excellency, &amp; sufficiency euen for the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest matters. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> no doubt, had receiued some measure of Grace and spirituall strength: but yet their owne deceitfull hearts made them to <hi>ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> it, and boldly to tell <hi>Christ</hi> asking them, <hi>Are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 20. 22.</note>
                  <hi>ye able to drinke of my cup, to bee baptised with my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?</hi> yes; <hi>we are able.</hi> Alasse poore men, that could scarse indure to see Christ himselfe drinke that cup, and therefore fled away when the cup was but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards him, how should you be able then to drinke it of your selues? Thus <hi>Peters</hi> heart deceiued him in like manner, when being but a <hi>nouice,</hi> a <hi>fresh water souldier,</hi> hee thought himselfe able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those enemies that might iustly haue danted the old trained, and best exercised and experienced soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Christ knowing the measure of his strength better then himselfe, told him, <hi>Whether I go now thou canst not follow mee, heereafter thou shalt.</hi> But <hi>Peters</hi> deceitfull heart, thinking it selfe too much disabled, answered, <hi>Why cannot I follow thee now?</hi> So true is that, euen in spirituall riches, which <hi>Salomon</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the earthly, <hi>There is poore which maketh</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 13. 7.</note>
                  <hi>himselfe rich.</hi> Therefore excellently <hi>Dauid</hi> not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this deceit, after hee had protested concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the soundnesse and zeale of his hatred of Gods wicked enemies, <hi>Doe I not hate them that hate thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps, 139. 22. 23.</note>
                  <hi>yes, I hate them with a perfect hatred,</hi> addeth (as something mistrusting his owne heart) <hi>Try mee</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:19272:72"/>
                  <hi>O God, proue me,</hi> namely whether I deceiue not my selfe in thinking I haue more zeale, then indeede I haue: of the two deceits it is the better, and safer, to vnderualew our selues; and with him that said, <hi>I am not a man, I haue not the vnderstanding of a man in me,</hi>

               <p>HEtherto of the deceitfulnesse of heart in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our persons: It remaineth to speake of the deceitfulnesse in iudging of our <hi>actions:</hi> but first wee must consider what vse wee are to make of the former.</p>

                  <hi>or no:</hi> our harts would make vs beleeue we were thus and thus: But the Scripture hath discouered our hearts vnto vs for noble impostors and deceiuers. Now who is there, that would easily beleeue a knowne deceiuer? Nay as it fareth with such that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceiue by speaking falsly, that they cannot bee credited of vs when they speake truely: the like sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and ielousie should we haue these false hearts in, euen then when they giue in right iudgement. <hi>I</hi>

                  <hi>know nothing by my selfe</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> mine owne heart <note place="margin">1. Cor, 4, 4.</note> doth not condemne me, and yet I dare not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud in bearing out my selfe vpon this iudgement, this sentence of mine owne hart will not iustifie me. Much deceit may be hidden therein: God, that is farre greater then our harts, sees that in them which they see not themselues: good reason hast thou then my brother, to mistrust the iudgement of thine own heart, concerning thy selfe, and those so perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sentences, which it causeth thy mouth to vtter, that if there were but one man to be saued, thou art the man. Oh how many sleepers are there, that dreame this dreame of a strong assurance of their saluation, that both liue and dye in this dreame, and so go downe merily to hell? where their paines shall be greater, by how much their expectation of them through the deceitfulnesse of their hearts, was the lesse. Is it not paine enough to be in hell, but thou must needs increase the paine by this wicked, and wilful <hi>selfe-deceiuing?</hi> Haue we then our eares in our heads, and marke wee well the voyce of these our hearts, when they suggest secretly vnto vs, Thou art in good case, the child of God, the beloued of God. Consider we whether our owne hearts may not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vs, whether the deuill may not delude vs. Rest we not in our owne hearts voice, neither accept we the deceitfull applause thereof; but as once <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Angell, examined him, <hi>Art thou on our side,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh, 5, 13.</note>
                  <hi>or on our aduersaries,</hi> so do we, hearing these words, try them whence they are: for <hi>the eare</hi> saith <hi>Elihu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 34, 3.</note>
                  <hi>trieth words,</hi> as the outward words of other mens mouthes, so the inward words of our own harts. Say
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19272:73"/> then to these words, to this secret crie, whence art thou, commest thou from gods spirit, or from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than?</hi> As wee must <hi>try the spirits,</hi> in the outward <note place="margin">1. Iohn, 4, 1.</note> wordes deliuered by men, so also in the secret thoughts of our hart, specially these concerning our owne estate to Godward, whether they bee the voice of Gods spirit, or of the euill spirit of error and illusion. It was vile for those clawing flatteres to say vnto a man, <hi>The voyce of God:</hi> much more for vs to say so to the Diuell himselfe. And what do we else, <note place="margin">Acts 12, 22.</note> when wee apprehend and applaud his mocking illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and lying suggestions, as the <hi>oracle of God,</hi> and goe away with them, as if God, from heauen, had told vs we were his. Try we then these sounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we trust them, &amp; carefully examine the grounds which thy heart can show to make good her so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident assurance. Heere especially remember those fearefull deceits of the <hi>Temporarie;</hi> how like a true beleeuer he is, and yet none; how neere hee comes to heauen doore, and yet enters not, how far he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in the way to Canaan, euen with those <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>Kadeshbarnea</hi> within eleuen daies iourney of the land, and yet neuer sees it, neuer enioyes it, but is as farre off, as if he had sitten still in Aegypt, and neuer stirred foote out of doore. Consider seriously with thy selfe how farre <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Iehu, Iudas, Ahab</hi> and others haue gone in humiliation, sorrow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, zeale, reformation, and yet for all this haue gone to their owne place. Deale now vnpartiallie with thy selfe, and tell mee whether thou doest not come short of many of these, who yet neuer hadst the heart, vpon the threatning of the word, to relent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19272:73"/> and humble thy selfe with <hi>Ahab,</hi> to confesse thy sins and desire the praiers of Gods children, with <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,</hi> to be affected with ioy in hearing the word, and practise many things with <hi>Herod,</hi> to bee zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne with <hi>Iehu,</hi> to lose some part of thy goods with <hi>Ananias,</hi> to forsake the world, and all thy hopes there, and to follow poore <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Iudas, Demas</hi> &amp; others, much lesse to venter thy life with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the copper-smith, in cleauing to the truth? may such as these be wicked reprobates, &amp; yet wilt thou please thy selfe in a false conceit of thine owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, who commest far further behind thē then they do behind true Christians? For vnto one of this rank, our <hi>Sauior</hi> saith, <hi>Thou art not far from the kingdom of heauen;</hi> but vnto thee it cannot be said, that thou art not far from <hi>Iehu, Iudas, Saul, Nicolas, Alexander</hi> &amp; other such like <hi>temporaries:</hi> for they, some of them specially, had many notable graces, so that <hi>Nicolas</hi> was chosen Deacon by the Church, for that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend respect they had of his gifts, <hi>Iudas</hi> was an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and could both pray and preach with great zeale; generally the common sort of them may bee inwardly affected in praier, conference, hearing the worde, feele many good motions, tast of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the life to come, feele some rellish in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, tremble at the threatnings, reforme all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruptions of life, as we haue already shewed. And thou that makest thy selfe so sure of heauen art happely a despiser of the worde and praier, a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse blocke, that neuer feelest the least glimpse of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny spirituall motion, a muddy worldling, that canst not raise vp thy spirit out of the mucke of the earth,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19272:74"/> into the heauens, to conceiue any one pure or refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thought. Why then hast thou not the wit thus to thinke with thy selfe? What? those that are Saints and Angels in regard of mee, are they yet deceiued in iudging themselues to be in state of saluation? how grosse then is my errour, in being thus conceited of my selfe? If some that haue iournied in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>Kadeshbarnea,</hi> shall yet neuer <hi>enter into Gods rest,</hi> shall those, that neuer left Egypt? Is the stonie ground <hi>reprobate ground?</hi> and can the <hi>high waie</hi> ground be good?</p>
               <p>As long then as thou art cast behind the <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie,</hi> thou art miserably deceiued, if thou thinkest well of thy selfe. So also art thou, though thou hast attained vnto him, vnlesse withal thou outstrip him, attaining to that which no <hi>Temporarie,</hi> as long as a Temporarie, either is or can be. O thou wilt say whats that? <hi>Ans.</hi> I haue already shewed it in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the particular deceits of the temporarie, yet thus much may be added. The chiefe difference <note place="margin">Wherein the true Christian goes beyond the vnsound. Luk, 8, 15.</note> our Sauiour, in the parable, maketh betwixt the best of the other grounds, and the good, is this; that those onely signified by the good ground, had <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest</hi> hearts: for the <hi>stonie</hi> and <hi>thornie</hi> hearers brought forth fruit, but they wanted this same <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest</hi> heart, and in steed thereof, had either a stony, or thornie: see then what it is wherein the true Christian excelleth the <hi>Temporary,</hi> namely, <hi>the good and the honest heart.</hi> The <hi>honesty</hi> of the heart is to bee referred to the intents it hath in the doing of particular actions: so that is an honest heart which aimes at the right in that she doth. The goodnes of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19272:74"/> the heart is to bee referred to the inward renewed good qualities. So that a good hart is a hart which by regeneration is changed; clensed and purged of the former naughtinesse, and so indued with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of nature, and disposition, whereby it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all sinne, and loueth, sauoureth, and affecteth things spiritual. Heere then is that we must narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine our selues by, if we will not be deceiued by our owne harts, in iudging our selues to be Gods children, when we are not. <hi>If any man</hi> saith <hi>Paul, bee in Christ he must become a new creature.</hi> He must haue <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17.</note> that same <hi>cleane heart</hi> of the <hi>Prophet created</hi> in him, <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 10. Eph, 4. 23.</note> and that same <hi>right spirit renewed</hi> in him. Hee must be renewed in the very spirit of his mind, in the most inward and subtle parts of the soule, as it were the <hi>quintessence</hi> of it. And this happely may also be the meaning of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> praying for the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they might bee <hi>sanctified throughout in their soules, bodies and spirits:</hi> by <hi>spirit</hi> vnderstanding the <note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 23. opened.</note> same thing that in the other place to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the best and choysest of both the parts, both soule, and body. Heere is the maine defect of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie. Though hee may seeme to bee renewed in his mind, yet not in the <hi>spirit of his mind:</hi> to be sanctified in soule &amp; body, yet not in the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>quintessence</hi> of both. Hee reserues that for some sinne or other, which is closely harboured, &amp; nourished there. Like as the thornes haue as it were the best spirits of the ground, and doe drinke vp the very <hi>creame,</hi> &amp; <hi>flower</hi> therof, so that the fruit comes to nothing, being rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of it nourishment by the thornes. Not but that there may be and are many secret corruptions in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19272:75"/> trulie regenerate: for euen the good ground may haue thornes: but yet these corruptions incroch not vpon the spirit of the soule; thats reserued for the grace and spirit of God; these thornes get not the <hi>fat</hi> of the soile; the good come feedes on that; the thornes doe not grow vp together with, &amp; so ascend <note place="margin">Luc. 8, 7. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:19272:76"/> then the common sort of the world, who know not what these feelings meane, that being the stonie, or thornie ground, thou art neerer to the nature of the good ground, then the high way ground: but what? because thou art come thus far in the way, wilt thou go no further? dost thou therfore think thy selfe well enough? no: as our Sauiour said to that yong man, so say I to thee, <hi>One thing is yet wanting:</hi> this same <note place="margin">Mark 10. 21.</note> good and mortified heart. There lies in thee some leauen of hypocrisie, that must needs be purged out, some roote of bitternesse, that must needs bee wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp, some thornes of couetousnesse, pride, vaine-glory, that must needs be cut downe. Lo, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou art come out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> thou hast gone a great way in the wildernesse, thou art not now farre from <hi>Canaan,</hi> thou art come euen to the very next borders: two or three strides more would set thee in the land it selfe. Wilt thou now foolishly mocke thy selfe to thinke thy selfe in <hi>Canaan,</hi> because thou art on Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> within sight of it, and so goe no further? Wilt thou thus loose all thy other labour and trauaile? hast thou done so many things, <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so many things in vaine?</hi> hast thou therfore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 4.</note> preached, heard, read, conferred, fasted, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the tants of the wicked all this while for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to go to hell together with them? Oh take a little paines more; thou hast many goodly graces, and they make thee to shine, as a goodly &amp; beautifull temple of the holy Ghost. Onely one thing is wanting; there is some errour in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I doubt me, it is sandie; thou must needs digge a little deeper: get a little more humility of spirit,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19272:76"/> and truth and purity of heart, or else when a storme comes, al thy other labour about the building will be lost. I am the more earnest in this exhortation, because of those fearefull shipwracks, which many ships richly laden with many pretious iewels of grace, haue suffered, in all ages, vpon this rocke of an euill, and vnrenewed heart. O then take heed of it, as the very bane and poyson of all grace, and so the onely cause of those many deceits of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary beleeuer. Enter therefore into those darke closets of thy heart, take the <hi>light of the word,</hi> in the one hand, and the <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> in the other: and whatsoeuer <hi>Agagite</hi> or <hi>Amalekite</hi> that light shal discouer, kill, spare none with <hi>Saul,</hi> make hauocke of all, an vniuersal distruction: saue but one, and thou destroiest thy selfe. Whatsoeuer bee the outward flourishing show of thy graces, if some sinne lye co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered vnder them at the core, it will poyson and rot them. Oh how much better to haue grace lye in the heart, couered vnder many corruptions, as it doeth often in the regenerate! for, when corruption lies at the hart, couered vnder many outward graces, then it eates vp and deuoures the nourishment which grace should receiue from the heart, and so our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces become <hi>leane staruelings,</hi> and in time the thorns that at first lay hid, sprout forth, and ouergrow the corne, and so vnhappily dash those hopefull begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which seemed to promise a very large &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haruest. Contrarily, though a man haue many, many corruptions, and yet truth of grace lye secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the heart, it will, by little and little eat out all those corruptions. We see then what it is wee must
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19272:77"/> specially labour for, if we would be freed from that deceit of heart, wherewith the <hi>Temporarie</hi> is begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with whom the Diuell plaieth, as the cat doth with the mouse. Hee lets them in some sort go out of his hands, in that he giueth them leaue to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and doth not hinder them in their ioy, and alacrity of spirit, or feruency of zeale, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he is said to be cast out in the Gospell; but yet as the cat will haue the mouse still within her reach, that if she offer to run away, shee may presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend hir: euen so doth the Deuill heere: hee is sure to haue thee within the reach of his paw, as long as thy heart within is polluted with the loue of any one sinne: see then if thou canst deceiue this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, thus sporting with thee (as sometime we see the poore mouse doth the cat) wholly escaping from him, by thrusting out that one sinne, that still possesseth and defileth thy heart, and in steed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of intertaining the word and spirit of God.

                  <p>Of the deceit of the heart in giuing directions for our actions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAuing thus spoken of the first part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse <note place="margin">The second deceit in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> of mans heart in iudging, namely in iudging of <hi>persons,</hi> now wee come to the second in iudging of <hi>actions.</hi> And this is two-fold, in <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging,</hi> in <hi>after-iudging.</hi> The iudgement of <hi>aduise,</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> for the doing: and the iudgement of <hi>censure,</hi> and sometimes <hi>correction</hi> after the doing of the actions.</p>
               <p>The deceits of the former kinde are almost infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. <note place="margin">1. in direction▪</note> The booke would swell to much, and I should but wearie my selfe and the Reader, largely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them all. Only I will point at some of the chiefest heads: These deceits therefore for <hi>direction</hi> are either in regard of the <hi>rules</hi> for the gouernment of our actions, or of the <hi>actions</hi> themselues.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>rules,</hi> our deceitfull hearts prescribe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">1. for the rules</note> three deceitfull rules, to square our actions by. First, the light of <hi>naturall wisdome;</hi> which being <note place="margin">1 light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> so much degenerated frō that at the first creation, &amp; of a cleare shining lampe, become a stinking snuf, who seeth not that this light is plaine darkenesse it selfe. <hi>The wisdome of the flesh, is enmity to God.</hi> Secōdly, <note place="margin">Rom 8. 7. 2 Custome.</note> the <hi>custome of the times</hi> and examples of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19272:78"/> it? or as though men should be so silly as sheep, to follow whethersoeuer their companions leade them? for surely how many things are there done which would argue the doers, either <hi>sheepishly simple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nemo dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret furere si cum paucioribus fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerent; nunc sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium est insani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiū turba.

Thirdly, our owne <hi>intention</hi> and meaning that if it be good, then so is the action also, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture refuteth by the example of <hi>Vzzah.</hi> These are crooked rules and blinde guides, which blinded <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>waies of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deceit of the heart in iudging of the actions <note place="margin">2. For the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thēselues.</note> themselues is either against the whole law, <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> or <hi>in speciall,</hi> against either table. All which to name were endlesse. Wee will only cull out some of the principall.</p>
               <p>First, against the whole law I obserue three more <note place="margin">1 Against the whole Law.</note> speciall deceits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>thoughts are free,</hi> that we shall not bee <note place="margin">1 Thoughts free.</note> accountable to God for them. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, though a learned <hi>Pharisee;</hi> yet was thus deceiued in iudging of thoughts, not consented to, which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the tenth commandement. <hi>I had not knowne</hi> (saith he of himselfe in his <hi>Pharisaisme) that lust had beene sinne, vnlesse the law had said, Thou shalt not lust.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> But the grossenesse of this deceit may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: for what reason is there, that the <hi>actour</hi> of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19272:78"/> treason should be punished, and the <hi>first plotter</hi> and <hi>contriuer</hi> should scape? Now the first beginning, &amp; hatching of any sinne is first in the thoughts of the heart. And if Kings wil haue their seruants in their accounts answer euen for pence, why may not God call vs to a reckoning euen for our smallest debts? And if men punish words and deeds, because they see and know them, why then should not God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish our thoughts which hee knowes farre better, then any man can doe our outward actions? Wee must therefore make conscience of the idle rouings of our braines, our very thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must stoupe, and do homage to God, who hath required of vs to be loued <hi>with all our thoughts,</hi> and <note place="margin">Luc. 10. 27. Psal. 4. 4.</note> biddeth vs <hi>tremble</hi> euen at the very first rising of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thoughts and motions in our hearts <hi>and sin not.</hi> But alas many doe inuert the sentence and in this kinde very boldly <hi>sinne, and tremble not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>words are but winde:</hi> yea but they are <note place="margin">2. Words winde.</note> such a winde as shall blow thee violently into hell, and shall be the bellowes to kindle, yea the fuell to feede the flames of that vnquenchable fire. <hi>For by thy words thou shalt bee iustified, and by thy wordes thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat, 12, 36. 37</note>
                  <hi>shalt bee condemned,</hi> and for euery idle worde must thou giue account to God at last day, vnlesse <hi>Christ</hi> haue giuen account for it before. What a dotage is this to thinke, that our tongue, <hi>our glory,</hi> may bee made our shame, our greatest ornament, our fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest deformity, our best, and yet withall one of our least members, a <hi>world of wickednesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That, <hi>The outward workes of the Law are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Outward workes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</note> That in the first table, it is enough to come to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19272:79"/> Church, and to mumble ouer a few praiers in ones bed, &amp;c: in the second enough to liue quietly and pay euery man his owne, and not to breake out into scandalls. This deceit possessed the Pharisees, who in their interpretation of the Law, restrained the prohibitions of murther and adultery to outward grosse murther and adulterie. So their <hi>Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries</hi> were not so broad, but their expositions of the Law were as narrow. In the same errour was he, that hearing the commandements of the second ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rehearsed to him by our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> answered, <hi>All these haue I kept from my youth:</hi> but wee must know <note place="margin">Math, 19, 20.</note> that the Law in euery commandement is spirituall, and binds the heart as well as the hand. <note place="margin">2. Against ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther table. The first</note>
               </p>
               <p>Against the <hi>first table</hi> these <hi>deceits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the workes of the first table are inferiour to the second: hence is that opinion, that it is easier to loue God then our neighbour. Hence also it is, that there is often seuerer discipline against drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, theft, blaspheming of great men, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst prophanation of the Sabaoths, blasphemous oaths, and other such like as great breaches of the first table, as the named sinnes are of the second. Whereas yet the <hi>first and great commaundement is, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God.</hi> 2. That God may <note place="margin">Math, 22. 38.</note> be worshipped according to our owne deuise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the warrant of his owne word: hence that Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isticall <note place="margin">

                  <hi>omni-religion,</hi> and that opinion that al religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do wel, a man may be saued in any: hence those swarmes of <hi>wil-workes,</hi> and worships, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we preferre before those commanded by God. But shall the King set downe himselfe the rule of his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19272:79"/> owne honour to be peformed by his subiects, &amp; not leaue it free to euery country clowne, to do as they list: and shall we, farre more vnable to set downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fashions for Gods religion, then the rudest ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke is for a Kings ciuill worship, shall wee, I say, take vpon vs to determine ought of our selues, in Gods worship? Men haue thought it a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, when their seruants being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe something, haue done otherwise; not yet in contempt, but because they did see that other way, which they tooke, to bee better for their Masters purpose, then that which was commanded them. <hi>Crassus</hi> caused his mason to be whipped, for <note place="margin">

Do <hi>men</hi> thus stand vpon it? <hi>foolish men,</hi> will they haue their owne waies followed, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place to the better courses of their inferiours; and can <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>foolishnesse</hi> is wiser then our best wisedome, can he take it well, that our folly should thus take head to it selfe, presuming to checke, and correct his wisedome?</p>
               <p>Against the <hi>second Table</hi> there are also many <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second.</note> as, That euery man may be for himselfe, and make the most of his owne, and doe with his owne as he list; that the <hi>officious</hi> and <hi>sporting</hi> ly is nothing, whereas <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. wee must not speake trueth to please men, much lesse then lye: that it is the signe of a base mind, to put vp an iniurie, which yet the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture termeth <hi>our glorie,</hi> and an hundred such like.

Like as many of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when they were brought into the desart, where was want of all things, in regard of that which was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they preferred <hi>Aegypt;</hi> as now many, blinded with the same deceit, prefer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie in the same respect, before the Gospell. But for the deliuering of our selues from this deceit, wee must know, that we must iudge of the goodnesse of the <hi>successe,</hi> by the goodnesse of the <hi>action,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily of the goodnes of the <hi>action,</hi> by the goodnes of the <hi>successe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this deceit, of iudging our sinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lawfull, and good, proper onely to the blinde worldlings, but incident also to those, that haue some knowledge, and sense of religion, yea often to the truely godly themselues. <hi>Dauid</hi> cries out, <hi>who</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal, 19. 12.</note>
                  <hi>knoweth the errours of his waies?</hi> How many secret sinnes haue the best, which they are so farre from accounting sinnes, that they beare themselues out in them, as iust and warrantable? Of this kinde was the <hi>Polygamy</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> whose liuing and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that sinne, without speciall repentance for it, is to be imputed to this deceitfulnesse of heart, wee now speake of. And so no doubt is it still with vs, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19272:81"/> many sinnes goe current with vs, without the least checke, in regard of the generall sway of the times. But this deceit is farre more grieuous in some, who being something like true Christians, (but indeede are not) are often fouly illuded by <hi>Sathan.</hi> So that as once <hi>Ioseph</hi> tooke the conception of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> to <note place="margin">Math. 1. 19.</note> be an adulterous seede; so these men contrarily take adulterous conceptions, that is some thoughts and affections which spring from pride, and vaineglory, to be spirituall conceptions of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> and to come from zeale, and piety; and as once <hi>Eli</hi> &amp; those mockers <hi>Acts</hi> 2. imputed the true worke of the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to <hi>drunkennesse:</hi> so these through the deceitfulnes <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1, 14.</note> of their hearts, father vpon the spirit certaine moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions, that are indeede the fruite of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of <hi>drunkennesse</hi> and <hi>giddinesse</hi> of intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minds.</p>
               <p>The second thing, wherein the iudgement of the heart touching our sinnes shewes it deceitfulnes, is <note place="margin">2 Excusing them, by</note> this; That if the action bee so grosse, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused in it selfe, yet to excuse it, as it was done by vs. That though it cannot excuse it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet it will exceedingly extenuate it, making it to be in vs, and as we did it, but a veniall, a petty and pardonable sinne. As the vniust steward in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell for a hundred pounds set downe fifty, so deale we, nay farre worse, with our debts to God, that is our sins. Talents are made farthings: and farthings meere nothings. Great sins are made little sinnes: and little sinnes no sinnes. And heere especially doth the cunning deceitfulnesse of the heart excell. It doth so straine and stretch it wits, euen as it were on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19272:81"/> tenter hookes for to finde out excuses, as it were fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues to couer our nakednesse, and thickets to lurke in, if it might be vnespied by God himselfe. This is that deceit <hi>Dauid</hi> meant when hee said, <hi>bessed is that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 32, 2.</note>
                  <hi>man in whose heart there is no Guile,</hi> namely to minse or mittigate the grieuousnes of his sinne, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of wittie and colourable excuses, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations. And this, as it may seeme, he spake out of his own experience in that his grieuous sinne, in the matter of <hi>Vriah.</hi> For in this point the Scripture tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him for want of vprightnesse of heart, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also himselfe at length, in his repentance, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of it in himselfe, crieth out, <hi>O Lord thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 6.</note>
                  <hi>louest the truth in the inward parts,</hi> therby implying, that in that sinne hee had discouered much deceit and want of trueth and vprightnesse; now in what more then in this, that he <hi>sewed cushions vnder his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes,</hi> that he might sleepe securely in his sinne, and after he had <hi>built the wall, he daubed it with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered</hi>

                  <hi>morter</hi> of his owne vaine and friuolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses; as that a King had equall authority ouer al his subiects, and therefore, since some must needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to more perill in the warres then others, hee might as well put <hi>Vriah</hi> to that hard lot, as another; that as long as <hi>Vriah</hi> was not slaine with his owne hands, but in the warres, hee was not guilty of his death, and diuers such like inuentions. And who shall not in some measure discerne this deceit? how busily will our hearts lay about them to finde some pretence or other for the lessening of our sins, to make them seeme lesse odious and vglie then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are? So that, though, when wee come to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19272:82"/> giue iudgement, we cannot wholly free our selues, but must needes giue in the verdict against our selues, yet we will doe it as fauorablie, and with as great respect as may be. Like <hi>Dauid</hi> that when hee could not but send his subiects against <hi>Absalom,</hi> yet willed them to haue special care of not hurting him. But when our deceitfull hearts would vrge vs to shew this fauor to our <hi>Absaloms</hi> to our darling sins, we should no more regard them then <hi>Ioab</hi> did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> charge concerning <hi>Absalom,</hi> but with stomacke and courage run them through with the two ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sword of the spirit, and not as vsually wee doe, <note place="margin">

We deserue double dānation, first for this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature, and then for the fruites of it, in our actuall transgressions; because as the drunkard is the cause of his owne drunkennesse, so wee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of our owne corruption of nature, for God made vs holy and righteous, after his owne image,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19272:82"/> but we our selues in our first parents defiled &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted this holy nature. And therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> when in that <hi>penitentiall</hi> Psalme his repenting heart euen studied with it selfe, how to make his sinne out of measure sinfull, and to raise it vp to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of rebellion, he bringeth in the mention of his corrupt nature, as an amplification thereof, <hi>In sinne was I conceiued, and in iniquity brought forth.</hi> And least <note place="margin">Psalm, 51. 5. 2.

               <p>The <hi>second cloake</hi> are the <hi>examples</hi> of the faults of holy and godly men, specially those in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as <hi>Dauids</hi> adultery, <hi>Peters</hi> deniall, <hi>Lots</hi> incest, <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkennesse, &amp;c.

               <p>The third shift is their <hi>ignorance,</hi> and want of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <note place="margin">3. Ignorance.</note> They say they are no schollers, nor book-lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And therefore, howsoeuer these things they are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19272:83"/> accused of, would be scarse tolerable in others, yet in them they are very excusable. For the discouery of this deceit, we must vnderstand, that there is a twofold <hi>ignorance.</hi> A <hi>plaine</hi> &amp; <hi>simple</hi> ignorance, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a wilfull &amp; affected. The plain &amp; simple ignorāce, <note place="margin">Excusat a tāto sed non a toto.</note> though it may extenuate, yet it cannot altogether excuse. The ignorance of thy princes Lawes will not excuse thee in his Court, and thinkest thou that in Gods court, who is farre seuerer then any mortall wight, the plea of ignorance shall be heard? for as the <hi>Princes</hi> lawes are printed and published, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be knowne, vnlesse we bee either carelesse or wilfull; so also are Gods. Art thou then ignorant? the fault is thine owne, it cannot therefore saue thee harmles.

But yet, if his ignorance, be the 2. kind of ignorance, <hi>wilfull,</hi> &amp; <hi>affected,</hi> then he shall be beten with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if not more: for this kind of ignorance increaseth the sin rather, then any whit lessens it, &amp; here, as in the case of drunkennes, dubble punishment is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily deserued; because they do willingly shut their owne eies that they might not see, and do of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <note place="margin">

               <p>THE <hi>fourth</hi> deceitfull tricke in cleering our selues, when guilty, is that of <hi>Translation,</hi> when by laying the fault vpon some other cause, we would altogether disburden our selues thereof.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19272:84"/> somthing, that must ease vs of all the burden of the blame.</p>

               <p>For first they should consider who <hi>Paul</hi> was that vsed these words, and of what sinnes, not <hi>open</hi> and <hi>grosse,</hi> from which euen his <hi>Pharisaisme</hi> was free, but of <hi>inward infirmities,</hi> whereby he felt the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his good workes to bee hindered. How shamefull then is it to bring that in defence of open scandalls, which is spoken concerning priuie and secret infirmities?</p>
               <p>Againe none can say concerning their sins, that they are not theirs, but the <hi>fleshes,</hi> saue they, who besides the <hi>flesh</hi> haue the <hi>spirit</hi> incountring the <hi>flesh.</hi> But in these kind of men, in whose mouths this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse is so ordinarie, there is no strife at all betwixt the <hi>spirit</hi> and the <hi>flesh.</hi> For they are nothing but <hi>flesh,</hi> neither is there any thing in them but corruption. Therfore it is an idle speech for them to say, <hi>not wee but the flesh,</hi> that is, <hi>not wee, but we.</hi> For what else are they but <hi>flesh,</hi> in vnderstanding, memorie, will, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, soule, and bodie, &amp;c? But yet when they are to commit some sin, they feel some resistance. True:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19272:85"/> but this resistance is not from the <hi>mind renewed,</hi> and <note place="margin">The differēce of the combat in the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from that which is in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

And hence it is that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat in the regenerate is in the same faculties of the soule, betwixt the will and the will, the affections and affections; because as euery part of their soule is partly carnall, partly spirituall, so also the will &amp; affections. Whence it comes to passe, that when the renewed part, of the will carries vs to <hi>good,</hi> the vnregenerate part, that is the <hi>flesh,</hi> swaies vs to <hi>euill.</hi> But the combat in the vnregenerate, is betwixt <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> faculties of the soule; as betwixt the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the will, betwixt the conscience and the affections: The will and affections of an vngodly man doe not holde backe, or make any resistance, when hee is tempted to sinne: for they are wholly carnall, and haue not either the least hatred of the sinne forbidden, or loue of the Law forbidding it, and therefore they are set a gogge, and <hi>drinke in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,</hi>

               <p> Well then the <hi>vnregenerate</hi> cannot excuse their sinnes by the flesh, because the flesh, and they being al one, in accusing the flesh, they accuse themselues. What then? may the regenerate? Neither: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>flesh</hi> in them is onely a <hi>slaue</hi> and <hi>captiue,</hi> deadly wounded by God, at first conuersion, and daily aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the contrariety of the <hi>spirit,</hi> that they yet should be foyled by the <hi>flesh,</hi> that the <hi>flesh</hi> should so farre preuaile with them, as to bring forth the fruits of disobedience, this seemeth rather to adde, then any whit to diminish of their sin: for as for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are nothing but <hi>flesh,</hi> they haue no aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the flesh in themselues, that might buckle with it: but the godly they haue the <hi>spirit,</hi> which of it selfe as <hi>Christ</hi> saies, is <hi>prompt and ready,</hi> but that wee by <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> our sloth and negligence disable it. Therefore the Scripture vpon these grounds exhorts the godly to good duties, because of the regeneration of their nature, whereby they are in some measure inabled to subdue their corruption, and so to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; as S. <hi>Iames,</hi> hauing made mention of our new birth: <hi>Of his owne will begat he vs, by the word of</hi>

                  <hi>feruently,</hi> annexeth this reason, <hi>Being borne a new, not of mortall seed,</hi> but immortall &amp;c. Now it is shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a man, that hath strength, &amp; is furnished with weapons, to suffer the theefe to take his purse from him: so is it for the regenerate man, whom God in his regeneration hath indued with spirituall life, and strength, whereby he might be able to striue against
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19272:87"/> and make his part good with the flesh, to suffer it to robbe him of any spirituall grace. Specially when as the flesh in them is as an vnderling, crushed &amp; trod vnder their feete. What a shame is this for a man to be ouercome by his base vassall, who was once alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before ouercome by himselfe. This therefore is matter of humiliation, and deeper aggrauation of our sinnes, that God hauing disarmed the <hi>flesh,</hi> and subiected it to vs, yet we by our fauouring of it, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> haue nourished a snake in our owne bosomes, and haue suffered it to grow to that head, that it should bee ready to ouertop vs. Therfore the Apostle doth not extenuate but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, the factions of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by this, that these things came from the <hi>flesh</hi> in them, and were fruites of their <hi>carnalitie.</hi> Therefore hee saies by way of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding, <hi>yee are yet carnall.</hi> Mans deceitfull heart <note place="margin">1 Cor, 3. 3.</note> would haue holpen the matter with this, Alasse! though we be regenerate, yet wee are still also car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in part: and the <hi>flesh</hi> will bee working. But the holy Ghost retorts it thus: as you are naturally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, so by your new birth, yee now are become spirituall: what a shame then is this for you, that the spirit performes his office no better in quelling the flesh, that the flesh is still so lusty and liuely in you, that one would thinke you were wholly carnall and not spirituall at all, that after so long a time of your regeneration, you are <hi>yet</hi> so carnall, the <hi>flesh</hi> still car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries so strong a hand ouer you. This shifting then of the fault to the flesh, is idle, whether in the wicked, or in the Godly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second translation</hi> of sinne is vpon the <hi>times,</hi>

Because the times gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are so corrupt and euill, therefore we thinke if we be corrupt in them, the fault is not <hi>ours,</hi> but the <hi>times.</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument is cleane contrary, <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the time▪ because the daies be euill.</hi> The badnesse <note place="margin">Ephes, 5, 16.</note> of the times did not serue with S. <hi>Paul</hi> for a cloake to excuse our conformitie to the times, in wasting our time wickedly, as others doe; but as a spurre to excite vs to bee so much the more carefull of our selues, not to be swaied with the common streame, in the idle and prodigall expense of our time, but to rescue it out of the hands of sinfull vanities, and to spend it wholly for the good of our owne souls. And good reason haue we to make this vse of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times; for, if the aire be generally infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, had we not need to be so much the more strict in our diet, and carefull in the vse of wholesome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues? Surely the worse the times are, the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer grow they to their ende, and therefore so much the more apprehensiue ought we to be of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of good, bycause the <hi>daie,</hi> in which onely wee can worke, is declining apace, and that fearfull <hi>night</hi> approacheth wherein none can worke.</p>

O say some concerninge the performance of good duties; if we might be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by authority, holpen by our ministers, set foreward, and hartened by those with whom, and of whom we liue, oh then how zealous should we be? but because we haue so many pinches, and pul-backes this way, we thinke our coldnesse, and backwardnesse in religion not so liable to censure. Thus many people impute their not profiting, to the minister, and the manner of his teaching. And if they had such a minister, oh how should they thriue then. But as he in <hi>Seneca</hi> hauing a thorne in <note place="margin">De tranquill. animi.</note>

Contrarily, many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters they blame their people, and thinke that, if their hearers would giue them such incorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in regarde of countenance, maintenance, desire to learne &amp;c, as some other people doe their ministers, they should then performe the worke of the Lord more carefully, and comfortably, then now they doe. But the truth is, the cause princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally is in our owne corruption, which being not reformed, no incoragements to godlinesse will much further vs, but being once redressed, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coragements can much hinder vs. Therefore, if a good, and throughly mortified Christian should liue vnder one of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> priests, or with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Dauid</hi> in a <hi>drie desert, where there were no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> yet he would thriue in the power of godlines; <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 1.</note> on the other side, an vnsound Christian, though he liued vnder <hi>Christs</hi> owne ministery, as did <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet he would come to nothing. So a good prophet, as <hi>Moses, Ieremy,</hi> and others, though yoked with neuer so crooked a people, would yet thence take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prouoking their owne zeale. An euill one, though he liued among the <hi>violent</hi> ones, that <hi>take the kingdome of heauen by force,</hi> would yet be cold, and carelesse. Let vs not then deceiue our selues, to <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 12.</note> lay our owne fault vpon the want of meanes, and so indeed vpon God himselfe. For that wee haue
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19272:95"/> not those meanes we so much seeme to desire, and in the hauing whereof we promise our selues such great matters of our selues; whence is it, but from God, that hath denied those meanes vnto vs? O if we liued vnder such a mans ministerie, if we enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dally companie of such, and such Christians, how should wee prosper then? why? but God hath not so disposed that we should. If there were such necessity of, and efficacy in those meanes, as we thinke, he would not withhold them. Thinke we not that God is in stead of all meanes to his, abundantly supplying them with the presence of his spirit; who as hee was a <hi>little sanctuary</hi> to his <note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 16.</note> people, when they were dispersed among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, so likewise still to vs now a little ministerie, a little colledge of Christians, when his prouidence hath depriued vs of these meanes. But lo an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conuiction of our deceitfulnesse of heart.

If the plea of custome be so weake for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of these sins before man, why then, as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> reasons, should it not be as insufficient for the maintenance of swearing before Gods tribunall. Though it had beene the Antiochians custome to wash them in the baths, yet, the king forbidding them, they all left for feare of his displeasure. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Chrysostome</hi> conuinced them of deceifulnes in the vse of this excuse, in pleading the <hi>tyrannie</hi> of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. Lo, saith hee, <hi>you may see that where feare is, there our wonted custome is left presently: feare easilie ouermasters custome, though it bee neuer so auncient and necessary.</hi> It is not then our custome, but our want of Gods feare, which is the cause of our swearing. The same Father in another place, maketh mention of one, who had got an <hi>ilfauoured fashion</hi> of mouing his right shoulder, when he went, which yet hee corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by laying a sword ouer it, in such manner, that it should be in danger of cutting, if so it moued. And so, by feare of incision, hee taught his shoulders bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manners and motions. Do thou, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest the custome of thy tongue in swearing the same
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19272:97"/> to thy <hi>tongue,</hi> that he to his <hi>shoulder,</hi> and in stead of his sword vse the sworde of Gods worde, and Gods iudgments threatned against this sinne, and thou shalt easily get ridde of this thy euill custome. For, let men say what they will, it is nothing but their owne hard hearts, voide of all feare of God and his iudgements, together with their sloth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in not striuing against their euill customes, that makes them such slaues vnto them.</p>
               <p>The last refuge is to helpe out the matter with some <hi>distinctions,</hi> and <hi>pretences</hi> of false ends, or any <note place="margin">6. Subtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</note> such like quirkes. This is the tale-bearers iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himselfe, I do it not to discredit him, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in loue and good-wil. So the wearer of long haire, I doe it not for pride, but onely to hide the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my eares, or to keepe my head warme. So the good companions, as they call them, that conuerse familiarly with notorious wicked persons, we doe it only for honest refreshment, and to winne them by kindnesse, as <hi>Christ</hi> conuersed with the <hi>Publicanes,</hi> &amp; sinners. So those <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were present at the idols feasts; We doe it not in honour of the idol, but only to gratifie our friends, in a thing indifferent, the eating of meats. Thus the Papists for their ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the creatures, say, they performe onely <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,</hi> but not <hi>worship,</hi> which is due to <hi>God</hi> onely. The man of vindictiue spirit, can distinguish betwixt <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing</hi> and <hi>forgetting,</hi> and tell you hee hath forgiuen his enemy, though he haue not forgotten the wrong hee hath done him. <hi>Bradford</hi> in one of his Epistles makes mention of one that excused subscription to the Popish articles being qualified with this limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19272:97"/> so farre forth as they were not against the worde of God, beeing indeede all quite contrary thereto. And in this manner he moued <hi>Bradford</hi> &amp; others to subscribe. But a notable example for this deceit was that of the Israelites in their oath against the giuing of their daughters in marriage to the Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites. For when the women of <hi>Iabesh Gilead</hi> did not suffice the Beniamites, and their oath hindred them <note place="margin">Iude 21.</note> from giuing any of their owne daughters, they bad them take by force of their owne virgins that should come forth to daunce in <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Why but was not this gainst their oath? yes, but mark what a fine quirk they found out to elude their oath, and so to qualifie the matter, namely that they did not giue them their daughters, but the Beniamites tooke them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Not much vnlike are those shifts to cousen the good lawes and oaths, against buying of places with monie, as the laying of wagers before hand with those of whom they are to bee had, That wee shall not haue such, or such a place. Such also was the deceit of those who hauing made truce with their aduersaries for certaine daies, did yet during the truce make incursion vpon them in the night, &amp; then defended it, because their truce was onely for daies, not nights. To this head also wee may refer that excuse of our trauailers, who excuse their kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Popes toe, because they doe that honour to him onely as a temporall prince, and not as Pope. But these men are not so happy in their inuentions, to saue their conscience, as was once one to saue his honour; who grudging the Persian king that honour of falling downe before him, and yet not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19272:98"/> knowing how to auoide it, purposely let fall his ring when he came into the Kings presence, and so excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the matter to himselfe, as though he fell downe only to take vp his ring, and not to worship the king. And diuers such like cranckes as these might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in. The which indeede are but curteins, we draw before our owne eies, to hide our sin; they are indeed, as the spiders webbe, cunningly wouen, and some slight of witt may there appeare in them, but withall they are as slight as the spiders webbe, they will not indure the breath, and blast of the mouth of God. Doe not then wilfully deceiue thy selfe. But thinke with thy selfe, will these distinctions, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences &amp; qualifications satisfie my conscience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the day of trial? And thus much for the harts excusing of our euill actions, as also for the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our hearts concerning our actions.</p>
               <p>The vse of all this is, <label type="milestone">

               <p n="2">2. Not to rest secure in the iudgement of our owne hearts. Many blesse themselues in their euill courses, because their seared and senselesse consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, their deceiued and deceiuing hearts doe not checke them. The trecherous selling of <hi>Ioseph</hi> was swallowed downe by his brethren, and did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19272:98"/> them for nigh twenty yeares afterward. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was, the mists of corrupt affections dazeled the eies of their minde, and so they could not beholde their sinne in the right forme, but when affliction had remooued these mists of deceit from their eies, then they beheld it, in the right shape, most ouglie, and monstrous, and were confounded with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour thereof. Had they any reason to approue their fact all that while, and to applaud themselues in it, because of this deceitfull peace of a deceitful heart. O saies one, I thanke God I finde quiet and peace in mine owne heart, whatsoeuer such, and such iudge of me for my courses. But what talkst thou of peace? or what hast thou to doe with peace (as <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Iehoram)</hi> who hast no other ground to build it vpon, then the deceitfull iudgement of thine owne blinde and bewitched heart? Thou lookest in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and seest no deformity in thy face. But stay till the water be setled and cleered, and then thou shalt see what a filthy mishapen visage thou hast. Tell me tenne yeere hence, or in the day of thy triall, when thy heart shall be freed from these deceits, &amp; <hi>Christ</hi> with the clay and spittle of some sharpe affliction shall haue sharpened thy dull eye-sight, tel me then what peace thou hast?</p>

                     <hi>Aug. in Psa.</hi> 46</note> often, vnder the colour, and in the appearance of mercy and compassion. As when wee releeue the needy with other folks goods, or (to vse <hi>Austens</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) when wee fauour a poore man hauing an ill cause, against a rich man hauing a good. In like manner <hi>giddinesse</hi> carries a blush of <hi>zeale:</hi> and <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and furie of <hi>valour,</hi> and manhood.

And yet, as they that haue ill eyes, will mistake one man for another: specially, when they somewhat resemble one another; though otherwise the difference betweene them bee palpable; and so salute a stranger for a friend: so our <hi>pore-blinde hearts</hi> deceiued with that shadow of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, which vice sometimes carrieth of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, doe oftentimes imbrace and receiue grosse vices, in steade of glorious vertues.

For <hi>yellow,</hi> or some such <hi>middle</hi> colour to be taken for white, is no such great deceit of the eies: but that <hi>blacke</hi> should bee taken for white, this is a strange deceit indeede. And yet this is the deceit of our hearts to shape out diuerse vices vnto vs, like those vertues, to which they are most extremely contrary. For example, not onely base <hi>deiection</hi> of mind goes vnder the account of true humilitie, but euen <hi>pride</hi> it selfe, as in those that seeke praise by disabling, and dispraysing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; as in <hi>Diogenes</hi> treading vpon <hi>Platoes</hi> chayre, and saying, <hi>Plato I trample vpon thy pride,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthily had that answere returned him, <hi>Thou tramplest on Pride with greater pride.</hi> Thus was it in those heretiques in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, so humble, that they would not presume to come to God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atelie, <note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> they would not dare to worship him, but the <hi>Angels.</hi> And yet of these men, in whom humilitie made so great a noyse, the Apostle is not afraide to say, <hi>that they are puft vp in their fleshly mind:</hi> lo a <hi>proud humility.</hi> And such is that of the <hi>Papists,</hi> in whipping themselues: for in these things they swerue from the wisedome of the worde, and follow their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. And what greater pride, then for a man to thinke himselfe wiser then God, to leaue the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his worde, and to exalt his owne fancie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it?

The primacie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishop at first, was onely in regard of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> not of <hi>the power</hi> &amp; <hi>iurisdiction,</hi> which afterward he obtained.

Assuredly in the iustice of God, punishing smaller sinnes with greater, they that make no conscience of smaller vntruths, in time come to haue such large consciences, &amp; wide throats, that they can swallow down grosse errors, as it were great gobs at once.

For howsoeuer the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sinne bee a painfull pleasure, a soure-sweete, which hath much bitternesse mixed; yet our hearts cunningly hide and conceale that. The flesh by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of temptation raiseth such clouds, that the light of our vnderstanding is taken away, as in <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his adultery, the flesh did so possesse him with the apprehension of the present pleasurable delight of his sinne, that hee could not thinke of that shame, that greefe, those wounds of conscience, those <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones,</hi> those sharpe corrections that were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <note place="margin">Psalm. 51.</note> Thus the Diuell dealt with our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> hee shewed him the world, and all the <hi>glorie</hi> therof.

But to deliuer our selues from the danger of this deceit; we must, when we are thus tempted with the sense of present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, cast our eies beyond it, and looke behind it, to see the long tail it hath of many sorrows, &amp; vexatiōs. We must labor as well to foresee what is to come as we see what is present: doth the Diuell shew thee, as once our <hi>Sauior</hi> a goodly sight of honor, glory, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, profit, &amp;c. in sin?

               <p>The 4. <hi>deceit</hi> is, when it perswadeth vs to sin, vpon hope of Gods mercy for pardon. This is a very vsuall &amp; dāgerous deceit. Like that of the diuels to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, Cast thy selfe downe headlong, for the Angels shal bear thee vp. So our harts to vs, cast your selues, implūge your selues into this or that sin: The mercy of God shall help you out. Poyson thy selfe: heer is a coūter-poyson. Break thy head: here is a plaister. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet: here is a Physitiō. An intollerable thing it is, that the mercy of God, the only inuiter and prouoker of our obediēce, through the sophistry of these naughty harts of ours, should be made an allurer &amp; very baud as it were to al filthines. <hi>There is mercy with thee,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Psal. 130. 4.</note> the Prophet, what? that thou mightest be despised, blasphemed? no; <hi>that thou mightest be feared.</hi> And the loue of <hi>Christ</hi> constraines <hi>Paul</hi> to dutie. Therefore <note place="margin">2. Cor 5. 14.</note> see what noble deceiuers our hearts are, that can make that an entiser to sinne, which of it selfe is the only powerfull, and constraining perswader to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. But let them take heede least their hope of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19272:110"/> mercie be not presumption. As a man passing ouer a bridge, which his false spectacles make to seeme broader, then indeed it is, being thereby deceiued, goes besides the bridge and so is drowned: so is it with those, whose deceitfull hearts make the bridge of Gods mercy larger then it is, they are in danger of falling beside it into the waters of eternal destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For thogh Gods mercy be of the largest extent, yet it is bounded with his truth. And therefor vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Scriptures wee finde these two coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Gods <hi>mercy</hi> &amp; his <hi>truth.</hi> So that Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may not be such, whereby his trueth in anie sorte should be impeached. As it should if it be prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it selfe indifferently, and promiscuouslie to all, as well the insolent and impaenitent, as the poore, humble and broken hearted sinner. For vnto these latter onely is the promise of mercy made. And if to the others the gate of mercie should be set open; Gods mercies (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saies of the wickeds that they are cruell mercies) should bee false, and vniust mercies. But God neuer yet learned so to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as to make himselfe false, and vnfaithfull.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fifth deceit</hi> is, when our hearts the better to <note place="margin">5. Deceit plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding necessity of liuing.</note> hearten vs to sinne, plead the necessity of liuing in this world, and maintaining our selues &amp; our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. O wee must needes liue, say some. And vnlesse wee doe thus, and thus (say breake the Sabaoth, lie, sweare, defraud, &amp;c.) wee cannot liue. <hi>Esau</hi> vnder this pretence sold away heauen. He was verie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, &amp; konwing not how to releeue the necessity of hunger otherwise, then by accepting of <hi>Iakobs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, accepted them. I must maintaine my life
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19272:110"/> saith <hi>Esau.</hi> At this present I cannot without some food, food I see none but my brothers pottage. This I cannot haue, without I buy it with my birthright. And thus he deceiued himselfe. The like deceit wee shall see in <hi>Demetrius</hi> the siluer-smith, who pleades hard for <hi>Diana,</hi> and the worship of her images by this very argument, <hi>Sirs ye know that by this craft we haue our goods.</hi> If <hi>Diana</hi> goe downe, our liuing goes downe with her. Thus would Sathan haue beguiled Christ, when in his hunger he perswaded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue himselfe by turning stones into bread. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to get our bread by falshood, oppression, wrōg, or any indirect course is a kind of turning stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bread. And, what good will such bread doe vs? Breade made of stones shall turne into stones, euen in the very eating. The bread of deceit though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so pleasant, yet in the mouth proues but grauell, saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> Prou. 20. 17. And no maruell. It was made of grauell and stones. And so returnes to his first substance. Another remedy against this deceit is to oppose a greater necessity of our soules liuing both heere &amp; hereafter with God. What dost thou tel me of the necessitie of thy liuinge here? There is one onely necessity for which there is no excuse, and is, not to offend God. <hi>One thing is needfull,</hi> saith <note place="margin">

                  <p>THerefore to proceede forward with these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; the sixth <hi>deceit</hi> is, A pretence that we will <note place="margin">VI. Deceit, Pretence of doing onely for trials sake.</note> doe such and such things [euill and vngodly] onelie for <hi>trialls</hi> sake, that by our owne experience we may the better learne the vanitie of sinne. For example, some will go purposelie to see masse, to the end, as they say, that they seeing the foolishnesse, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse thereof might learne to loath it the more. The like pretence is vsed for seeing of plaies, that by seeing many filthy sinnes (which the Apostles would not haue once so much as to bee named) represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and acted on the stage, wee shall learne to hate those vices the more. But God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed better schoolemistresses of the hatred of sinne, then the practise of sinne. Why should we leaue the meanes appointed by God to worke this hatred of sinne, and deuise other meanes of our owne? Is this the best way to learne continency, to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19272:111"/> exercise and trade our selues in vncleannesse? Was there euer any that learned sobriety by haunting ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes &amp; ale houses? temperance out of the schoole of Epicurisme? chastity in the stewes? I denie not but God who draweth light out of darkenesse can heale the wound of the viper with the flesh of the viper, &amp; can make sinne, contrary to it owne nature, to work our good, driuing out one poyson with another. What then? because the learned Physitian can heal vs with poysons, shall wee therefore bee tampering with them our selues? So in stead of health we may quickly meete with death. No, <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe was deceiued in this point; as his Ecclesiastes shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And his experience may teach vs, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to trye the heat of the fire by putting in our finger. Hee gaue himselfe to a pleasurable delicious life onely for triall sake, to make proofe of it, what was in it, that if he could not finde happy tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 3.</note> of minde, hee might leaue it so much the more willingly. But alas how miserably was he hampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the snares therof? How was he by this meanes drawne on to that fearfull apostacie in his olde age? shall not his experience make vs wise? shall any man now thinke hee can safely beare that burden, which hath already broken <hi>Sampsons</hi> backe?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seuenth</hi> deceit is, when we ground our liberty <note place="margin">VII. Deceit, Presuming vpō that good we haue.</note> which wee take of sinning, vpon those good, either graces we haue, or actions we doe; perswading our selues that a little dramme of some goodnesse in vs will waigh downe many talents of wickednesse. For as we can couer in our brethren many vertues vnder some one infirmity: so contrarily in our selues (so
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19272:112"/> cunning and crafty are our hearts) manie, not sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infirmities onely, but euen grosser deformities also vnder some one, poor, petty, (happely) show of vertue, rather then vertue it selfe. Thus the ciuill man thinkes his prophannesse and carelesnesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is sufficiently couered vnder his vprightnesse, and iust dealing in the things of this life. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing hypocrite thinkes his zeale in outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may beare him out in his vncharitable, vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and vnreasonable dealing with men. As if <hi>Herod</hi> should haue thought his hearing of <hi>Iohn</hi> a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient priuiledge to him for his incest. Thus noblie doe our hearts deceiue vs, making vs beleeue that a great heap of chaffe can lye hid vnder a little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of corne, that a little dimme candle light can chase away the foggie palpable darknesse of Egypt. Whereas the contrary is the trueth, that our little good is rather obscured and eclipsed with our many and great euils. As in the parable of the sower, the thorny ground is said to bring forth no fruit, <hi>Luc.</hi> 8. 14. and yet before, verse seuen, it was saide that the thornes sprung vp with the seede, so that the seede did not perish in the ground, but sprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foorth, and yeelded some fruit; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as <hi>Marke</hi> saies, the thornes <hi>grew</hi> vp, or <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 4 7. Math. 13. 7.</note> as <hi>Mathew</hi> speaketh, namely aboue the fruit, therefore the fruite of this ground is no fruit, it lies buried vnder the thornes, it is ouertopped, and choaked by them. Lo now, the fruit does not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>thornes,</hi> but the <hi>thornes</hi> the <hi>fruit.</hi> It is not said there were no thornes, because of some hopefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of fruit, but contrarily, no fruit because of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19272:112"/> the thornes thriuing, and increasing. Were it not absurd to reason thus, what though there bee many poisonfull herbs in the pot? yet there are some good ones, and so the porridge may be good. Nay, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many good hearbs, there were but one poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull in the pot, a man might say truely, <hi>Death is in the pot,</hi> yea that there were no good hearbe in it; because the poyson of the one hath taken away all the goodnesse of the other. So in truth where there is but any one sinne nourished and fostered, all other our graces are not onely <hi>blemished,</hi> but abolished, they are no graces. But most of all is this decit dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the true children of God? when they shall the rather presume in some things to sinne, because they are the children of God, members of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so cannot bee seuered from him, and because they are beautified with so many excellent graces, which they thinke will easily obtaine pardon for some small defects. Thus were the seruants in the primitiue Church deceiued, when vpon occasion of their calling, they shooke of the yoake, and because they were Gods sonnes, would no longer bee mens slaues. And thus would the Diuell haue deceiued Christ, when he would haue had him presumed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his priuiledge of beeing the sonne of God, and thereupon haue cast himselfe downe from the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Temple. <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 6. This deceite is so much the more lamentable, in that these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought rather to bee bridles to restrain vs from sinning, and spurres to pricke vs on to further grace, and obedience. For the more honour God hath giuen vs, the greater care should wee haue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19272:113"/> it, according to that of <hi>Paul: walke woorthy of that high calling. Should such a man as I,</hi> saith <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, goe into the temple to liue?</hi> Againe, hast thou some graces, some good things in thee? O then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them not with sinne, but make them as grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as thou canst, by adding vnto them what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that so there may be a sweet proportion, and comely conueniency in the spiritual body of Grace. For as it were an absurd speech to say, I haue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of my body seemely, and comely, legges, hands, eies, lippes, cheekes; therefore it matters not for my deformed and misshapen nose; no body can see this blemish among so many ornamēts; yes they will see it, and marke it so much the rather, and the deformity of thy nose is made more conspicuous by the conformity of thy other members: so also alike absurd is it to perswade our selues, that because of some ornaments in our soules, the many monstrous enormities thereof will be winked at. Is any woman so foolish as to thinke because her face is very faire, and beautifull, therefore she may specke and spot it heere and there with mire and dirt? or because her clothes shine and glister, therefore shee may staine them? Whereas the fairer the face, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the greater is the disgrace of the spot, &amp; stain. So also would any man be so sencelesse, as to thinke thus, because I haue a good sute, good stockings, cloake &amp; band, therfore I may wel enough put on an olde dusty, worne, and torne hatte. No; this will disgrace all the rest of his furniture; and it would be nothing so great a sore in the eies of the beholders, if his dublet and hose were tattered, his shooes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19272:113"/> musty, his stockings broken, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>eighth deceit</hi> is, when wee presume the rather <note place="margin">IIX Deceit, Hope of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king amends afterward.</note> to sinne, because we thinke to make amends for it afterward, by some good deeds, as prayer, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, alms, &amp;c. The couetous man sees a pray, some rich booty, wherby he may benefit himselfe much, in the iniury and oppression of his neighbour. Yea but his conscience tels him, oppression is sin, how then may he doe it? His deceitfull heart suggesteth, that if afterward hee bee a little more bountifull in giuing of almes, hee shall make an aboundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his sinne, and so bids him sticke no longer at the matter. In this one particular <hi>Austen</hi>

                     </note> both propoundeth, and discouereth this deceit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notablie. <hi>The extortioner,</hi> saith he; <hi>saith thus vnto me, I am not like the rich man in the gospell, I feast the poore, I send sustenance to the prisoners, I cloath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, I entertaine the strangers.</hi> To whom hee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. <hi>Thou thinkest thou giuest.</hi>
                     <q>Doe not take away, and thou hast giuen. He reioyceth to whom thou hast giuen: but he weepeth from whom thou hast taken away. Which of these two thinkest thou will God hear? Thou saist to him to whom thou hast giuen, be thankful for that thou hast receiued: but on the other side the other man saith, I mourn for that thou hast taken away: God hee saies to thee, foole I bad thee giue, but not of other folkes goods. Know thou foole, who ofthy spoiles &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines giuest alms, that when thou spoylest a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, &amp; robbest him, thou robbest Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And if they shall be sent to hell that did not cloath Christ (that is a Christian) when naked,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19272:114"/> what place shall they haue in hell that made him naked when he was clothed? Heere happelie thou wilt say, thou strippest a Pagan, and clothest a Christian. Euen heere will Christ answer thee, oh spare to damnifie me. For when thou who art <note place="margin">Parce dammis meis,</note> a Christian doest thus oppresse a Pagan, thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest him from becomming a Christian. If thou hast then of thine own, giue; if not: better for thee to gratifie none, then to grate vpon any.</q> So far <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,</hi> excellently shewing the grossnes of this deceit, that <hi>we may robbe Peter, if afterward we will pay Paul therwith.</hi> This kinde of deceit seemeth to haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Saul</hi> to that his disobediēce, in retaining the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> flockes. Hee thought belike the staine thereof would easily bee washed out with the bloud of his sacrifice, whereof hee speakes so much afterward to <hi>Samuel. The people tooke it to offer to the Lord thy God in Gilgal.</hi> And so the whoorish <note place="margin">1. Sam, 15, 15. 21</note> woman thinkes the like water will purge away all the filthinesse of her lusts. <hi>I haue peace-offerings</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Prou. 7. 14.</note> shee, incouraging her selfe, and her youth in their sinnes) <hi>at home, and I haue paid my vowes.</hi> This seems also to haue beene the deceit of the Pharisees, as some read that <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 41. <hi>Yee giue almes,</hi> (namely of goods gotten by rapine, &amp; pillage) <hi>and then all will be clean,</hi> the blot of your vniustice you think is sufficiēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed away. A horrible thing, to think that God will thus be corrupted, &amp; made to wink at our sinne. No: <hi>He that offreth to the Lord of the goods of the poore, is as he that sacrificeth the sonne before the Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 34.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But heere is a double deceit. 1. that we can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for our sinnes by any of our workes. 2. That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19272:114"/> wee may boldly sinne. For first, say that thou couldest satisfie God for the wrong which thy sinne doth to him, maist thou therefore lawfully offer wrong and violence to him? wouldest thou thinke thy neighbour might lawfully steale from thee, if after he would make some restitution? or breake thy head, if after he would giue thee a plaister? But then it is not so, that any works of obedience can satisfie for thy former disobedience. If thou wert bound to a man in two seuerall bonds for two seuerall debts, and hauing forfeited one, shouldst afterward pay the other, wouldst thou be so foolish as to think, that by paying this latter, thou hadst sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the former? If a seruant, hauing loytered al one weeke, should painefully labour all the next, would his master yet indure him pleading the last weekes diligence, as a sufficient recompence of the formers negligence? No. For it was his duetie to labour both weekes. So the obedience thou perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to God, is a debt due to him: thou canst not pay one debt with another. If a chapman, hauing gone long in the merchants books, should at length pay for that he tooke last, had hee therefore satisfied for all that was taken before? And yet this is the fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish deceit not of the <hi>Papists</hi> alone, but of many of our selues also (for naturally there is much of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish leuen in vs) to thinke that if after wee haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we be for a while a little more carefull, then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, of prayer, confession, reading, hearing, and such like exercises, then all is well againe. But <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells vs, that the sacrifice of the wicked is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord. And therefore the exercises
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19272:115"/> of godlinesse performed by such as wallow in sinne without repentance cannot pacifie his wrath.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ninth deceit</hi> is when we perswade our selues <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> Deceit, Pretence of insuing good.</note> to the committing of some sinne, vpon pretence, either of the consequence of some great good, which otherwise cannot be had; or the preuention of some greater euill, which otherwise cannot bee auoided. Hence that deceitfull rule, <hi>of two euils chuse the least. Lot</hi> was caught in this snare, when he would haue redeemed the greater sinne of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> against his ghuestes, with the lesse against his daughters, when he would haue preuented <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy</hi> by permission of <hi>adulterie.</hi> So <hi>Herod</hi> hauing sworne to gratifie the request of that dancing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for the auoyding of the sandes, rushes vpon the rocke, preuenting <hi>periurie,</hi> as hee thought, by <hi>mnrther.</hi> But the truth is, A man is neuer so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed betwixt two euils, but he may finde an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <note place="margin">

Now as concerning the hope of some good that may insue, here <hi>Lots</hi> daughters were caught, as well as their father in the former. For when they fell into that foule abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of incest, in all likelihoode this was that which preuailed with them, a hope they had that by this meanes, in their fathers posterity, the Church of God (otherwise in their opinion neere an end) should bee vpheld, and preserued. And was not here a goodly colour, to commend incest vnto them, the preseruation of the Church from ruine? But had not <hi>Abraham</hi> as good a colour for to haue spared <hi>Isacke</hi> contrarie to gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? euen the same that they had, the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19272:115"/> and saluation of all the elect, which hee might feare would haue binne buried in <hi>Isackes</hi> ashes, of whom he knewe the Messiah must come. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not had a sound heart indeed, here had binne fit place for this deceit. The lepers were thus deceiued, when, contrarie to Christes commandement, they diuulged the miracle of their healing. Their reason was to declare <hi>Christs</hi> glorie, and their owne thankefulnesse. But they should haue learned, that as when God commands thinges otherwise forbidden, then they are noe sinnes; as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> case: so when he forbiddeth thinges otherwise commanded, then they are noe <note place="margin">1. Sam. 14. 24.</note> partes of obedience, whatsoeuer plausible persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions wee may frame to our selues. <hi>Saul</hi> also was thus deceiued when for the better ouerthrowing of the Philistimes, he forbad the people to eat any thing til the euening. So <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when for gaininge the blessing she taught her sonne how to lie. <hi>Austen</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Confess. 1. 16.</note> makes mention of some that iustified the readinge of the immodest, and lasciuious writinges of the heathen Poets vnto yonge boyes, by the good that comes of it, namely the fining of the tongue, the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hinc verba di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuntur. hinc eloquentia &amp;c.</hi> Pro. 23. 23.</note> polishing of the speach. That which is good is pretious indeed, and according to <hi>Salomons</hi> rule, we are to <hi>buy</hi> it, but yet not to our disaduantage; with the losse only of worse thinges, not of better thinges then that we buie. We must not buy elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and <hi>good wordes</hi> so dearly; as with the losse of <hi>good conscience:</hi> we must not redeeme our little finger, with the losse of our eies. For, as excellently <hi>Austen, Good wordes are not more easily learned by those</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:19272:116"/>
                     <hi>filthy writinges: but filthinesse is more confidently practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non omnino per hanc turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem verba ista commodius discuntur, sed per haec verba turpitudo haec confidentius perpetratur.</note>
                     <hi>by reason of those wordes.</hi> Whatsoeuer good it is we may thinke to come vnto by sinning, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that hurt wee doe to our owne soules in sinning. It were madnesse to loose a thousande pounde, to gaine an hundreth: much more to loose it for nothing, missing of that hoped for hundreth. So is it here in this deceit. In not sinning: when we are tempted there is an vnspeakeable good: now when wee sin vpon hope of some great good, first we loose the good of absteining from sinne, of keeping our soules pure from that defilement. This we wittingly loose. Now that great good, we thinke to winne by this losse, is in comparison with this, but as a dramme to a talent. This were bad enough, one would thinke: Yet here is not all. For besides the losse wee purposely put our selues vnto, we loose also that we hoped to gaine by this losse, both the talent, and the dramme too. As <hi>Saul</hi> when by his wicked execration, and cruell prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of foode to the people thought to haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the victorie against the Philistims, indeede he hindered it, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> obserued. For if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not binne out of heart for want of foode, they might far more valiantly haue pursued their aduersaries. And so it fareth with vs, as with the dogge in the fable, that letting fall the flesh that was in his mouth, to catch at the shadowe thereof, lost both that he had, and that he thought to haue had, both substance, and shadow too. For indeed that good, which we procure by sinning, is rather a shadowe of good, then any true good. When we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19272:116"/> doe euill that good may come thereof, though the thing it selfe be good, yet to vs it is not good. Our sinne in procuring it, hath altered the nature of it. If this were well thought of by some, they would not so deceiue themselues, as they doe, in vsing base shiftes, and indirect, and vnhonest courses, for the inriching of their state, vpon pretence of doinge good to the Church, whereto they say they shall thus be inhabled. I tell such, that the good which thus they doe to the Church, in them is no good, but turned into sinne. For as in <hi>Iob</hi> it is said that <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 7.</note> we may not <hi>lie</hi> for God, so neither may wee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, defraude, or do any other euill either for God, or the Church of God. Hee knowes how to prouide for his Church without thee. He will not be honoured, with the price of a dogge, and a whore. He needes not thy <hi>vertues,</hi> much lesse thy <hi>sinnes,</hi> either for his owne glory, or his Churches. <note place="margin">Deut. 23. 18.</note> Neuer feare, that either of these will fall downe, though they seeme neuer so much to shake, vnlesse thou (as once <hi>Vzzah</hi> his hand to saue the arke) put vnder the proppe of thy sinne. But against this deceit for euer remember that golden rule of the Apostle, <hi>Wee may not doe euill,</hi> (no not the least) <hi>that good</hi> (though the greatest) <hi>may come thereof.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>tenth deceit</hi> is, when we therefore presume <note place="margin">X. Deceit, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our purpose still to continue godly.</note> to go on in our sinnes, because our meaning is, if we may beleeue our heartes, to continue also in the practise of godlinesse, as it were parting stakes betwixt God, and the Diuell. If our hearts should persuade vs so to inthrall our selues to sinne, as wholie to renounce Gods seruice, and shake off his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19272:117"/> yoake, this would not so easily bee granted. But now when they beare vs in hand, that still we shall continue gods seruantes, notwithstanding our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice performed to sinne, wee quickly apprehend this, and thinke this will bee fine, if wee can both please God, and our own naughtie hearts too. This was <hi>Salamons</hi> deceit in his first declination, when he began ouer much to hearken to the inchantments of pleasures; that for all his pleasures, hee would still continue his former exercise of piety. But when once he had gon thus farre, to admit of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with God, in the seruice of his heart, they could not long indure Gods partnership, nor yet God theirs, and so <hi>Salomon</hi> at length gaue ouer the seruice of God, and serued idoles. Neuer then let vs thinke that we can ioyne together thinges so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable, godlinesse, and wickednesse. It is a hard matter to exercise two seuerall trades: much more two such contrary trades, as these two. Neuer let vs be so grosse, as to thinke we can reconcile things altogether irreconcileable, <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Sathan;</hi> ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serue two contrarie Masters, <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Mammon, God,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus, God,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The <hi>Mammonist</hi> flattereth himselfe in his worldlinesse, because hee purposeth still to continue his zeale and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in religion. But this is impossible. For how can such a worthy princesse as <hi>Grace,</hi> indure such rouges for hir bedfellowes, to lodge with hir in our hearts, as are couetousnesse, voluptuousnesse &amp;c. no; grace must haue all, or none. If any sinne haue but a part, it must haue all. Loe then notable craft. If you will let such, and such ghuests in to haue
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19272:117"/> some roome, they will not bee any vnquiet neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Grace shall inioie hir roome still. But when once they are got in, Grace is so annoied that shee is faine to depart presently. And so all falles to their share.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>eleuenth deceit</hi> is, when wee flesh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <note place="margin">XI. Deceit, from humane law on our side.</note> our selues in our sinnes, because of some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes which may seeme to fauour them. Though yet, indeed, they only <hi>tolerate</hi> them, and not <hi>allowe</hi> them. Thus the common vsurer decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him selfe, why the law allowes ten in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? yea but the law only stintes, and limites it to ten in the hundreth, and so farre giues way to it, for the preuenting of a greater mischiefe. And this will not be enough to excuse the vsurer in the <hi>court of conscience.</hi> Thus the Iewes deceiued themselues in the matter of their <hi>polygamy,</hi> in hauing many wiues and in their diuorces for euery trifle. They thought <hi>Moses</hi> law had allowed them in these sinnes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our <hi>Sauiour</hi> sheweth, <hi>Moses</hi> onely gaue a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 18.</note> because of the hardnesse of their harts. So in the matter of maintenance for the ministery, many, though rich and able, yet refuse to giue any thing, be cause they haue not those things, the tithes whereof the Law requires for this purpose. Yet the Law of God is plaine, <hi>let him that is taught make him that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6. Numb, 35, 8.</note>
                     <hi>him, partaker of all his goods.</hi> And againe in the cities which the other tribes must giue the Leuites, God wold haue this proportiō to be kept; such tribes, as had more cities in their inheritance, should part with more: such as had lesse, with fewer. By the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of which proportion, those that are richer, are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19272:118"/> bound to giue more to the ministery, then the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. And yet, if this colour of humane law wil serue the turne, they may giue lesse. For the poorer may haue tithes payable by the Law, when the richer haue none. But Gods Law requires that, according to our abilitie, whether our estate bee in matters tithable, or not, that matters not with God, wee should maintaine the ministerie.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>twelfth deceit</hi> is, when therefore wee flatter our selues in our sinne, and thinke wee may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <note place="margin">XII. Deceit, from our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in sinning.</note> doe it, as long as wee keepe a moderation in sinning, and doe not lash out so farre as doe others. Thus many thinke they need not sticke to ride vpon the <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> though for trifling, triuiall causes, so they stay an houre by the way to heare a sermon, &amp; doe not wholly spend it in trauelling, as some doe. Thus many beare themselues out in their hard and vniust dealing with the poore, because they vse not all that cruelty they might, and that others doe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they onely clip off the <hi>wool,</hi> and not the <hi>liuing flesh:</hi> it may bee they take but halfe the forfeiture of a band, it may be they restore halfe of the worth of the pledge, when it is forfeited. So theeues thinke if they leaue some mony in the trauellers purse, and let him scape with his life, which was in their hands, they are so farre from being to bee accused for their stealing, that rather they are to be commended for their mercy, and moderation in stealing. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> though hee followed his lust in lying with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 4.</note> yet he would not lye with her, but being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, according to the Law. And lying with her so, his deceitfull heart made him thinke hee might the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19272:118"/> more safely do it. But this deceit is not hard to bee discouered. Doth <hi>Dauid</hi> indeede make conscience of <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> and yet none of <hi>morall</hi> puritie? doth the theefe make conscience of leauing one twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the trauellers purse, and none of taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreths out of it? So in the remitting of halfe the forfeyture, I aske of thee, whether the same reason that makes thee giue one halfe, should not presse thee to giue the other also, thou hauing no more right before God to keepe the one part then the other?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>thirteenth deceit</hi> is, in wresting the Scripture <note place="margin">XIII. Deceit, wresting the Scripture to be for vs.</note> to make it serue our turne. And if once our deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts can finde the least colour for our sinnes there, then runne we away with it, and take libertie to sin boldly. It shall not be amisse to see this in some particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For liberty in sinning prophane ones alleadge <note place="margin">Eccle. 7. 11. 19. explaned.</note> that of <hi>Salomon, Be not iust ouermuch.</hi> So a man may be too forward, and precise. And againe, Bee not wicked ouermuch. So then a man may bee wicked moderately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The former words are not to be vnderstood of true righteousnesse, as though there could be too much there, but of a deuised righteousnesse of our owne, without the worde of God. Such as is that of the <hi>Papists</hi> in whipping themselues. Therefore <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> addes in the same place, <hi>Neither bee too wise,</hi> Make not thy selfe wiser then God, in prescribing to thy selfe a stricter righteousnesse, then his word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth vpon thee.

As for the latter words, of not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too wicked, they doe not giue vs leaue to bee wicked in any sort, though neuer so little, no more then the Apostle, saying, <hi>Let not sinne reigne,</hi> doth <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> thereby giue liberty to vs, that sinne may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so it reigne not; or then he doth, when he saies, <hi>Let not the sunne go downe vpon your wrath,</hi> thereby giue liberty to bee angry till the sunne set. But as there the meaning is, that if it be so that we cannot wholly be free from rash anger (which were to bee wished) yet we should not nourish it, but labor with all speed to quench it: so also heere, that if it bee so we cānot altogether be free from the taint of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, yet that wee should keepe our selues from lashing out into the excesse thereof, as the common sorte doe, no farther are the wordes to bee stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For continuing impenitently in their sins they alleadge that of <hi>Salomon, The iust man falleth seauen</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>last deceit</hi> is, the inuenting of inuasions, how to <note place="margin">XIV.

                     <hi>Answer</hi> is made, that it is onely to be vnderstood of such haire, that is as long as womens. But as it is said of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that their <hi>Phylacteries</hi> were <hi>broad,</hi> but their <hi>expositions</hi> of the Law <hi>narrow,</hi> so it may be said of these men, their <hi>haire</hi> is <hi>long,</hi> but their <hi>exposition</hi> of this Scripture is very <hi>short;</hi> whiles they restraine the worde, which signifieth to nourish the <note place="margin">

Thus conscience of sinne is traduced as precise nicenesse, and needlesse scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity; obedience to Gods lawes is thought the basest bondage, Psalm. 2.

But, as the wicked, to bring the godly into hatred, haue alwaies raised vp slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reports of them, that they are thus, and thus, (as of the Christians in the Primitiue Church, that they were enemies to the Emperours, practisers of vncleannesse in their meetings, &amp;c.) when indeede they are nothing lesse: so doe our hearts craftily mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informe vs of vertue, and as once they of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes,</hi> tell vs terrible things of it, to bring vs quite out of conceit with it.</p>
               <p>The second is, when our hearts would onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">II.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19272:123"/> looke to the losse, but to the gaine also inclosed in this losse. Art thou to giue almes, and doth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of money trouble thee? Consider also the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and increase of that which thou expendest. Hast thou lost any thing in thy outward estate? Giue thanks to God. And consider not the greefe which thy losse, but the ioy and comfort which thy thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing offordeth thee. Art thou reuiled, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? beare it with a good spirite, and thou hast more cause to glory in thy <hi>patience,</hi> then to grieue in thy <hi>repreach.</hi> We see the husbandman considers not the sowing in teares, but his haruest, his reaping in ioy. The fisherman lookes not to the casting in of the net, but to the draught, nor the merchant to his sea-voyage, but to the returne of his merchandize: so must wee not so much looke to our losses, crosses, afflictions, as it were the showring &amp; lowring seeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but to our reaping time, our haruest, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Sauior, the blast of the trumpet, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> glory prepared for vs. With <hi>Moses</hi> we must looke to the recompence of reward, and the eternal waight of the <hi>crowne</hi> must waigh downe with vs the light and moment any waight of the <hi>crosse.</hi> And as in sinne wee should haue a fore, not seeeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but feeling also of the paines, when nothing but tickling pleasure presents it selfe: so in obedience, of the pleasure, when nothing shews it selfe to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye, but paine and trouble. If thus we can doe and truely conioyne those things which our cunning hearts fraudulently sunder, the <hi>crowne of thornes,</hi> and the <hi>crowne of glory, Golgotha</hi> and <hi>Caluarie, cosuffering</hi> and <hi>coreigning</hi> with <hi>Christ;</hi> then shal we account the

For the lesse our reward is heere with men, the greater may we assure our selues shall it bee heereafter with God. For if cruell man haue so much good nature, as to see the paines, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue taken for him, to be recompensed: thinke we that the God of mercy can suffer them to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded of him, that haue suffred so much for him?</p>
               <p>Yea but in present thou saist thou seest, and feelest nothing but paines, punishments, troubles, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations. First, this is not so. Much comforte, and sweetnesse of delight is there in the very act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in regard of the peace and ioy of conscience; as contrarily much torture, and terror in the very act of sinning: for heere euen in laughing, the heart is sorrowful, as in the way of obedience, euen in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart is light and cheerefull. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, though there were no heauen, nor future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of glory, yet the godly life, with all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thereof, were to bee preferred before the sinfull with all it pleasure; onely because of the sweet qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and contentment of an vnguilty conscience, whereas the wicked haue a tormentor within, a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning conscience. The mudde and mire of which raging sea troubleth, and distempereth the pleasures of sinne, which yet, if vntroubled, should last but for a season, hauing a most miserable succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour to follow, endlesse and remedilesse sorrow. So quicklie in sinne doth the pleasure fade and vanish, leauing behinde it perpetuall pain: wheras in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience contrarily the paine is transient, the pleasure
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19272:124"/> eternallie permanent.</p>
               <p>Now that in obedience first thou hearest and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of the worst, and the better is reserued for the time to come, this ought the rather to hearten thee thereunto. As beeing an argument that there is no deceit which here thou needest to feare. For where deceit is ment, there the best things that may tickle <note place="margin">

                  </note> and tempt vs are shewed, the worse are concealed, till afterward. As for example, those that steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way children, doe not tell them of rods and stripes, but of plummes, apples, cakes, babies, hobby-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and such like knackes, that vse to please children; And then hauing thus caught them, the poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren afterward feele much woe and miserie; so in catching of birds and fishes, their daily foode, that they delight in, is shewed them: the snare, the hook they feele afterward. And thus do our hearts, as we shewed, deceiue vs in perswading vs to sinne by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting to our senses the pleasurable delights therof, not telling vs of the <hi>after-claps.</hi> But now in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the word of God first tels vs of the <hi>griefe,</hi> then of the <hi>glorie,</hi> first of the <hi>labour,</hi> then of the <hi>rewarde,</hi> first of the <hi>teares,</hi> then of the wiping <hi>handkercher,</hi> first of the <hi>race,</hi> then of the <hi>garland,</hi> first of the <hi>fight,</hi> then of the <hi>kingdome.</hi> Is not this plaine dealing to let vs know the worst before hand? Doth not God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deale as a Father with his childe? And will a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coosen and circumuent his owne childe? No. And yet first, in his childhood, he tels him of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere schoole-master, of the swindging roddes, of the hard feruler, and of such like terrible things. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he is come to age, hee tels him of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19272:125"/> and passeth it ouer to him. Lo then what a strange deceit this is, for our hearts to make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that to be an argument of Gods deceiuing vs, which is so cleere an euidence of his faithfulnesse. If now wee were told onely of pleasures and delights, we might suspect deceit, and feare there would bee none in the ende. But now hearing nothing but of the crosse, of gall, &amp; wormewood, we may the more perswadedly assure our selues, that the wine and hony will come, and that beginning with the dolefull darknesse of the night, wee shall end in the ioyfull light of the day. Where ioy hath the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there feare of greefe makes our ioy greeuous: where griefe; there hope of ioy makes our greefe ioyfull.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is, from the remembrance of that good <note place="margin">IV. Deceit, remembrance of that bypast.</note> which we haue already done. Whereupon we falsly inferre that wee may now sit downe, and rest vs a while, as hauing done enough for our parts. This seemes to haue beene <hi>Iehues</hi> deceit. Hee thought it enough he had destroyed <hi>Ahab</hi> his posterity, and idols. He thought this a great matter, and therefore that the doing of this might well excuse him for the not destroying of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calues. But <hi>Paul</hi> had done far more, and yet forgat that which was past, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> and still pressed towards the mark, notwithstanding hee had so happily combated with his corruption, that he could say, <hi>I am crucified to the world, and the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note>
                  <hi>world to me,</hi> yet he still continued <hi>beating downe his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note>
                  <hi>bodie.</hi> So <hi>Timothie,</hi> though a rare man for mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet continued still in the vse of such seuere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, that <hi>Paul</hi> was faine to stay him, and bid
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19272:125"/> him drinke no longer water. But marke heere the deceit of our hearts in turning the <hi>spurre</hi> into a <hi>bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi> For there cannot be a more forcible incitement to proceeding on in grace, then from our owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and former practise. All lost, if wee giue ouer, before the race be fully run out. Wherefore S. <note place="margin">Phil. 8. 9. expounded.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> perswades <hi>Philemon</hi> to shew mercy to <hi>Onesimus</hi> by reason of his former practise of that grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others; for hauing said, <hi>Wee haue great ioy and and consolation in thy loue: For by thee brother the saints bowels are refreshed,</hi> hee inferreth presently this <hi>Wherefore I beseech thee for my sonne Onesimus.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh thou his bowels, as thou hast done others of the Saints. Stil hold out in the exercise of this grace, that thou maist receiue a full reward. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he reasoneth with the Corinthians, <hi>As ye haue abounded in loue, and knowledge &amp;c: so see yee abound</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cori. 8. 7. cleered.</note>
                  <hi>in this grace</hi> [of liberality] <hi>also.</hi> Wee, contrarily, thinke our aboundance in some graces may dispense with our defects in others. But, as in the parable of the lost sheepe, the sheepheard leaueth the sheepe he hath, and seeketh out that he wants: so should we heere. In our thoughts, at least, leaue those graces thou hast. Doe not so stand thinking of them, that thou shouldest neglect that which thou hast not. In the parts of our bodies none so foolish as to reason, no matter for the want of mine eye, because I haue eares, nose, &amp;c. No souldier so senselesse, as to say, no matter for a head-peece, because I haue a brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate. In the furnishing of our houses, if one onely ornament be wanting, wee doe not thinke the want made vp in the rest, which we haue, but contrarily,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19272:126"/> that wee ought so much the rather to prouide that which is wanting, because of those we haue. In run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of races, the people hollow, and shout not to the hindermost, but to the formost that are neerest <note place="margin">

               <p>The fifth is, from comparing our selues with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are worse, as the Pharisee compared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the Publicane. Hence wee gather, that as long as we haue others farre behind vs, we need not so bestirre vs. This deceit is like that of the drapers, that commend a carsey by laying it to a rugge. Wel in other things we doe not so deceiue our selues. A man of some competency in his outward estate, if he see a begger that hath nothing, will not thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conclude that he is rich enough, and neede seeke for no more. No, but if there be but one richerman then himselfe, he is an eye-sore. As long as hee sees him, he thinkes himselfe poore. So the runner in a race hastens his pace by looking to those before, not slackens it by looking backe to those behinde. So should we rather cast our eies vpon those that are of greater eminency in grace, then our selues, and then hang down our heads, and couer our faces in shame to see what <hi>nothings</hi> we are, and then put to the spur to this dull iade, our naughty flesh, that wee may make more hast in our iourney.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19272:126"/> not suffering the Scriptures to be reade of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, because of the hurt that may come of it. <hi>Austen</hi> makes mention of some, that neglected <note place="margin">

               <p>THere remaineth yet one deceit more in this kind, for which, it being somthing more large, <note place="margin">VII. Deceit, inuention of false reasons or shifts.</note> we haue reserued this chapter. And that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of false reasons, to deteine our selues from performance of duetie. For euen in such dueties, whereto we haue bound our selues by vow, we will yet go about to slip the collar, &amp; to vntie the knot: which <hi>Salomon</hi> intimateth in that Prouerbe, <hi>It is a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro, 20. 25. explaned.</note>
                  <hi>snare after the vow to inquire,</hi> namely colourable reasons to elude our vow: Much more then will our deceitfull hearts do the like for those duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tyed only by Gods commandements. For if they haue sleights to loose a duble knot, both of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and vow too: much more then a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19272:127"/> knot of a commandement alone. To exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this in some particulars; Many, when called to the supper of the Lord, pretend their want of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and vnfitnes, by reason they are not in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with their brethren. A notable deceit! For why doe they not vpon the same ground refuse to pray also, because loue and vnity are as well required heere, as in the Sacrament, yea a sincere profession of it, <hi>forgiue vs, as we forgiue,</hi> &amp;c? When, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique reformation of religion, vnder <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> there was some backwardnesse in the Priests and Leuites, and they happely with the sluggard were readie to hold the hand in the bosome, and to crye, A Lion in the way, This innouation will bee dangerous, wee dare not be seene in it: <hi>Ezekiah</hi> (as after him <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Paulus</hi> Consull, when no body else durst, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ranne in the hatchet into the temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> the demolishing whereof the Senate had decreed) began first himselfe, and awakeneth these sluggards with these words. <hi>O be not deceiued my sonnes. God hath chosen you, &amp;c.</hi> As if he should say, I know your <note place="margin">2. Chr. 29. 11.</note> hearts are cunning and deceitfull enough to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest false reasons, to discourage you, but harken not vnto them. Doe your dutie. So also in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ministerie, because of the manie vaine shifts which men haue for their base and illiberall dealing with vs, saying: We liue idlie, and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but speake a few words, &amp;c. Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing exhorted the <hi>Galathians</hi> to this dutie, to take <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> away all their wittie excuses, addes, <hi>Be not deceiued, God is not mocked.</hi> Thereby shewing, that as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other things, the deceitfulnesse of our hearts
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19272:127"/> shewes it selfe, so in this, namely the forging of idle reasons, to satisfie, &amp; bear out themselues in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duties, cōmanded by the word of God. And as this deceite is in the people, in denying the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister his dues, so also in the minister in denying the people theirs, the due namely of spiritual inspection, and instruction. For heere some pretend, that for a while they withdraw themselues, that they might follow their studies in the vniuersitie, and so bee the better fitted for their charge. When yet <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> for the Churches behoofe, forsooke <hi>Pauls</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his deere Master, with whom if he had abode still, neglecting the Church, hee wanted not this pretence, that hee did it to furnish himselfe with greater store of knowledge. For <hi>Paul</hi> might haue beene in steed of many vniuersities to him. So in the matter of patience, this is an vsuall shift to excuse the want of it, oh if I had deserued it, I could haue borne it. Whereas <hi>Peter</hi> shewes that we ought so much the rather to be patient, when the euill wee suffer is vndeserued, because then patience is most praise-worthy, when it is most prouoked. And iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 19. 20</note> doe more prouoke patience, then deserts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, in vndeserued euils, wee haue the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our owne innocency to comfort vs in that griefe, which the smart of the euill bringeth. All which comfort is wanting, when the euil is deserued. And lastly in the dutie of liberality, how witty, and crafty do men shew themselues, in deuising reasons to saue their purses, as that they haue charges of their owne, they know not what neede they may come to themselues, &amp; diuers such like. And hence
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19272:128"/> it is, the Greeke worde, which the Apostle setteth out liberalitie by, signifieth <hi>simplicitie,</hi> in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that crafty and witty wilinesse, that is in the Couetous to defend themselues from the danger as <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 2.</note> they thinke of liberality.</p>
               <p>But, to omit these particular instances, which are infinite; there are fiue more generall, and common shifts, which men vse to auoid the practise of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>

But say that, as once <hi>Ezekiah</hi> thou hadst a lease of thy life for some certaine space of yeeres: yet still the deceit should be the same; for thogh thy life may cōtinue longer, yet how knowest thou that Gods call also will still continue? or if that doe, whether he will giue thee his grace to answere vnto it, who hast already so contemptuously reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it? Assure thy selfe, hee that will not bee fit for God to day, will be lesse fit to morrow. For heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in specially is the deceitfulnesse of sinne to be seene,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19272:129"/> that still, the longer it cōtinueth with vs, the greater strength, and interest it getteth in vs, and so as the Apostle shewes, it hardens our hearts, and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables vs for good duties then before.

Such a fore-skinne will bee growne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thine heart so thicke and brawnie, that hardly will the most powerfull motions pierce through it. Doe wee not see how easily the crookednesse of a young twigge may be corrected? let it alone till it bee growne a confirmed tree, it is inflexible. Alas how many haue there beene, who deceiuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with an opinion of repenting heereafter, as thinking the present time when God called them, vnseasonable, afterward, seeing their error, and how they had let slip the season, haue houled with <hi>Esau,</hi> and haue then cried out, they could not repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the season was now past, it was now too late. What a cunning trick of thine is this, O thou deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hart? when thou shouldst do good, to say, It is to soone, the time is not yet come, Hereafter I will doe it? and yet when this thy <hi>heereafter</hi> is come, then to say, now it is too late, the time is past. Let vs not then be thus deluded, suffring the time of grace to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe vs to our destruction.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19272:129"/> it now a time for thee to talke of deferring thy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for them? If thou come not out and harnesse thy selfe for the battell in all the hast, thou wilt be vtterly ouerthrown, before thy <hi>heereafter</hi> be come. Why shouldest thou deale with Christ like the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, who cried against him comming to dispossesse them, <hi>Why art thou come to torment vs before our time?</hi> For so many account the practise of godlinesse a torment.

                  <hi>and I will giue thee if now thou haue it.</hi> I cannot say indeede, that when God to day calls for rhy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, thou hast it, of thy selfe, then to giue it him. Yet this I may say, say not to God, Come againe to morrow, and thou shalt haue my repentance, when to morrow thou shalt be lesse able to giue it, then to day. O that thou couldest be wise to know rhe time of thy visitation, and to apprehend the occasions &amp; gracious opportunities of thy good, while they are offered; to obserue the time of the spirits mouing in thy heart, as once those sicke men did of the Angels mouing in the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and with like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to take it for thy soules health, as they did that for their bodies.

O that we could be as wise spiritually, and take our penniworths of the Gospell, while it lasteth, and whiles it is yet day, ply our work before the twelfth houre be gone, and that fearefull night ouertake vs wherein none can worke. O that <hi>in this our day,</hi> as Christ with teares wished for Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, wee could know the things belonging to our peace! Let vs not deceiue our selues in thinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are young, we haue therfore time enough before vs, we need not make such hast.

But after this day is once gone, there neuer comes a new day, to worke the work of the Lord in againe. O but the day of the Gospell among vs hath beene, and so still is like to be a long day. Well, bee it so. But then the day of thy life may bee short e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and then the other is thine no longer then thou liuest. When thou art dead, what good wil the Gospell doe thee then? Yea, but then the day of my life may be a long day. For I am young and healthy. Well grant thee that too, yet the day of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the grace of God may bee out before the day of thy life. And then what good will thy life do thee? One of these two may easily bee, that if the

               <p n="3">3. Shift is frō extraordinary occasions; as in those <note place="margin">3. Shift. Speciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Luc. 14. 18.</note> in the parable; when inuited to the supper, excused
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19272:131"/> themselues with the buying of farmes, oxen, &amp;c. But this is meere deceit. The true cause indeede, why they would not come, was, because their farmes &amp; oxen had bought them. Their affections had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled, and sould themselues to this worlde. And therefore our Sauiour, presently after the parable ended, addeth these words, <hi>He that hateth not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 26. expounded.</note>
                  <hi>mother, wife, children, yea &amp; his owne life,</hi> much more his farme, his oxen, <hi>cannot bee my disciple.</hi> It was not then the farme, the oxen, but the inordinate affection to those things, that they loued them more then they did Christ, that detained them. This was the true impediment which Christ in these words toucheth. The things of this life are burdens indeed pressing our soules downe, but not in themselues. Al the waight they haue in this kinde, they receiue it from our owne corruption. Which the Apostle sheweth, ioyning these two things together, <hi>Casting away euery thing that presseth down,</hi> that is, the things <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. cleered.</note> of this life, <hi>and sinne that so easily incompasseth vs.</hi> It is this latter that makes the former burdensome to vs. Therefore they in steed of saying, <hi>I haue bought a farme, I haue married a wife,</hi> should rather haue said, <hi>I haue sould my selfe to the inordinate loue of my farme, and I haue married my selfe to the foolish and carnal loue of my wife, as well as to my wife.</hi> Some cases indeed there are, wherein that rule of our Sauiour hath place, <hi>I will haue mercy, and not sacrifice.</hi> And then the occasion hindering the dutie is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, then the dutie omitted. And the neglect of that occasion would haue left a deeper wound in our consciences, then of the dutie. As in <hi>Hannah,</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:19272:131"/> if, for the going to the sacrifice at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> shee had neglected to shew mercie to her poore infant, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it sucke. But heere many deceiue themselues, to make euery entertainment of a friend, euery gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipping or marriage dinner, or some such like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be a sufficient cause to iustle out the seruice of God? And this was <hi>Marthaes</hi> deceit, rebuked seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by our Sauiour. Notwithstanding the meeting of friends in <hi>Zecharies</hi> house, the circumcision of the child on the eighth day was not neglected. The Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were but in an vnsetled tumultuarie estate, <note place="margin">Luc. 1. 58. 59.</note> in the wildernesse; and yet, for all that, they did not post off the duety of thankesgiuing, till they were peaceably possessed of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And for all their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remooues in the wildernesse, and the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, yet they seeme to bee chalenged by the Lord for the neglect of circumcision.</p>
               <p>Fourth <hi>shift</hi> is that, which is rife in the mouthes <note place="margin">4. Shift.

For if they bee ordained to destruction, it will nothing aduantage them; they shall loose all their labour: if to saluation, though they liue neuer so wickedlie, it shall nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or disaduantage them. They must needs come to their appointed end. But these must know that it is impossible, either for a reprobate to liue godly, or an elect alwaies to liue lewdly and loosely. For the same God that ordeines the ende, ordaines the means. Those whom he hath ordained to saluation hee hath also ordained to good workes, that they <note place="margin">Ephes 2. 10.</note> should walke therein. Why then wilt thou deceiue thy selfe in this case, more then in the matters of this
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19272:132"/> life? for there thou wilt not reason, God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how long I shall liue, therefore I will eate no meat, because Gods decree must needs stand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I eat or fast. Heere thou wilt haue the wit to answer. God indeed hath ordained how long I shall liue: but withall hee hath ordained that the time I shall liue, I shall liue by the vse of meanes. Much more shouldest thou vse this answere in this case. For thou knowest not but God may miraculously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy temporall life without meanes: but thou maist assure thy selfe; God will neuer worke such a miracle, as to bring a sinfull irrepentant soule into heauen.</p>

Thus the foole puts off the studie of knowledge, pretending <note place="margin">Pro, 24. 7. <hi>Nolle in causa est. Non posse praetenditur.

How can I cōprehend them al? But heere the truth is, that want of <hi>will</hi> is the true cause, though want of <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>power</hi> be pretended. For these men are like bankrupts, who though they be able to pay some part of their debts, yet refuse to pay any thing, because they cannot pay all. So these vpon pretence of their vnability to doe all required, will not endeuour to doe any thing at all. <hi>Dauids</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:19272:132"/> practise was cleane contrary. For he proposing to himselfe that perfection of obedience required in the Law, farre aboue the reach of any man, <hi>Thou hast commaunded thy precepts to bee kept very much,</hi>

For thereupon hee infers presently, <hi>O that my waies were so directed that I might keepe thy statutes.</hi> Here to deliuer our selues from this deceit, we must remember that God accepts <hi>affecting</hi> for <hi>effecting, willing</hi> for <hi>working, desires</hi> for <hi>deeds, purposes</hi> for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, pence</hi> for <hi>pounds,</hi> and vnto such as do their endeuour, hath promised his grace inabling them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day to do more, and more. Which grace when once we haue, then shal we see how false it is which our hearts tells vs, concerning the paine and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of godlinesse.

As it is thus in couetousnesse, so in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and all other sinnes. Did not <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> promise vnto themselues in the eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree, the glory of the godhead? For what else meaneth that bitter scoffe, and salt sarcasme of the Lord, <hi>Behold man is become as one of vs.</hi> But what <note place="margin">Gen. 3 22.</note> was the issue? <hi>Moses</hi> tels vs. <hi>Then were their eies ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they saw their nakednesse,</hi> they saw how they were mocked, how for the mines of golde, they had met with cole-pits, nay for heauen, with hell, for a throne of glory, with the dunghill of ignominy.

               <p n="2">II. Wee deceitfully promise to our selues the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyment of many outward blessings, which yet wee neuer get. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> promised himselfe victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Dauid,</hi> beeing shut vp in <hi>Keilah, The Lord</hi> saith he, <hi>hath deliuered him into my hand.</hi> So also did the <note place="margin">1. Sam, 23. 7.</note> Iebusites triumph against <hi>Dauid,</hi> as though they had bene sure enough for euer being ouercome by him. <note place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 6.</note> This deceit we may see in the craking of <hi>Goliah,</hi> and <hi>Senacherib,</hi> who had in their presuming hope, got the victorie of their aduersaries before the conflict, and so putting on the harnesse gloried as those, that put it off. And we may easily discerne it in our selues, who too too easily beleeuing such things as wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire should come to passe, do often make our selues sure of them, when yet in the ende wee come short of them. Heerein deceiuing our selues, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell would haue deceiued our Sauiour. <hi>All these things will I giue thee,</hi> saith he, which yet were not in his power to giue. No more are any of the least of these things in our hands which wee so confidently assure to our selues. And therefore to this deceit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we <hi>Salomons</hi> counsell, <hi>Boast not of to morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring foorth.</hi> Many
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19272:135"/> things fal out betwixt the cup and the lip, insomuch that oftentimes we enioy not those things which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Deut. 28, 30.</note> almost we haue in our hands.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Our hearts deceiue vs in promising, I know <note place="margin">3. Happinesse in inioyment.</note> not what contentment and happinesse in the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these outward blessings, when yet the euent answereth not our expectation. O saith the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart of man, if I might haue this or that which I desire, so much liuing, such or such an office, or preferment, how comfortable and solatious a life should I lead? well, when he hath his wish, it fareth with him almost, as with the Israelits in their quales. He findeth more vanity and vexation of spirit, in the presence, then he did before in the want of this his so much desired good. Hence also that phrase of the <hi>deceitfulnesse of riches,</hi> because they do not perform that which our hearts promise vs concerning them. In the same regard all worldly honours are called <hi>lies</hi> by <hi>Dauid, O ye sonnes of men, how long will ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after lies?</hi> The lye indeed is in our own false harts. <note place="margin">Psalm. 4, 2. expounded.</note> We make them lyers, in that we promise such great matters to our selues of them. Whereas in end the <hi>leaning staffe</hi> becomes a <hi>knocking cudgell,</hi> &amp; the <hi>prop</hi> to sustaine vs, like the <hi>Aegyptian reede</hi> proues a <hi>pricke</hi> to pierce and paine vs, and as <hi>Iob</hi> complaines of his friends, all these matters which we thought would haue beene vnemptiable fountaines of comfort, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs like a brooke,</hi> whose waters faile in the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> when we haue greatest vse of them. Thus <hi>Eue</hi> promised her selfe great matters in <hi>Cain,</hi> and he was the man obtained as a speciall blessing of the Lord, and his brother was called <hi>Habell,</hi> vanity, as beeing no
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19272:135"/> body in regard of him. But afterward this her son, on whom she so much doted, proued a very thorne in her side, and pricke in her eye. So concerning <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah,</hi> it is noted that hee loued <hi>Hannah</hi> more then his other wife, promising no doubt greater matter of comfort to himselfe in her, then in the other. But what followed? <hi>He loued her,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>and the Lord made her barren.</hi> Marke the coniunction of <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 5. If any would rather haue, (And) in this place to bee a rationall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, shewing that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loued his wife because of her crosse in barrennesse crauing his pitie; I striue not. Luc. 12. 19. 20.</note> his louing her, and Gods making of her barren. So shall it bee in all such earthly creatures, whereunto we cleaue inordinately, falsly promising ioy to our selues in their vse. God, in his iust iudgement, shall make them barren, so that they shall not yeelde vs a quarter of that comfort, or benefit, which we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The rich foole hee promised himselfe a little heauen in his riches. <hi>Soule take thine ease, &amp;c.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how soone did God <hi>disease</hi> him? <hi>O foole, this night shall they take away thy soule,</hi> and where then is thine <hi>ease?</hi> The reason of this deceit is, for that we, in our expectation of these outward things, before they come, apprehend onely the good, and the sweet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the soure, the pleasure, diuided from the paine: but, in the fruition, wee feele both, yea more of the soure, then of the sweete. And hence it comes to passe, that nothing pleaseth vs so well in <note place="margin">Nihil aequè ad ep tis et concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centibus gratū.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19272:136"/> that which they haue in themselues, that so hauing them he should begin to despise them, finding lesse, then he looked for before he had them. Nay our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion doth not so much runne ouer in conceiuing of temporalls, as it comes short in the apprehension of eternalls.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Our hearts deceiue vs in promising vnto vs <note place="margin">4. Freedome from iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; hope of heauen in sinne.</note> both freedome from Gods iudgements in sinne, and the fruition of his mercies in the neglect of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In the one, cunningly separating the ende from the meanes, hell, damnation, iudgment from sinne; and in the other the <hi>meanes</hi> from the <hi>ende,</hi> holinesse, righteousnesse, from salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: telling vs, wee may enioy the end without the meanes, glory without grace, a plentifull haruest without seede sowen. As the <hi>Diuell</hi> would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued our Sauiour, promising him safe descent from the temple without going downe by the staires: so heere would our hearts deceiue vs promising a sure ascent vp into heauen without going vp by the staires of the workes of obedience. A feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing it is to see men goe on boldly in their sins, and yet as boldly to promise heauen to themselues. O foolish sot, who hath thus bewitched thee to thinke, that after thou hast begunne and continued in sinne, thou shalt end in glory, that after thou hast liued many yeeres heere in this world, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but shamefully dishonoured that God which made thee, with thy filthy beastly life full of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie, that yet in the end God wil honor thee with the glory of his Saints. <hi>Bee not deceiued</hi> saith <hi>Paul. Neither fornicatours, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:19272:136"/>
                  <hi>wantons nor buggerers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells vs that God hath called vs vnto <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 3.</note>
                  <hi>glory and vertue.</hi> To <hi>glorie,</hi> as the ende, to <hi>vertue</hi> as the way leading vs thereunto. Neuer then looke for glory, but in the way of vertue. God hath chained these two faster together then that they should bee seuered. So also hath hee sinne and shame. And yet how many are there, like that man that <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note> speakes of, who when hee heares the curses of the Law read, yet blesseth himselfe in his heart, saying, <hi>I shall haue peace, although I walke according to the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse of my heart?</hi> When the ministers of the word threaten in the name of God, his iudgements against sinne, are there not, who say in their hearts, Tush these are but skar-crowes? God means no such matter, this is but a pollicie to keepe men in awe. These are such as the Prophet saies haue made a couenant with hell, and death, and the rest of Gods iudgements. How could a couenant, will some say, be made with hell. Truly, true couenant can there <note place="margin">Es. 28. 15.</note> be none; but only the deceitfull heart of man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades it selfe of a couenant, and so bears vs in hand that wee shall bee past by vntouched, whatsoeuer scourges come. We may see an example of this in <hi>Eue;</hi> who rehearsing Gods commandement and threatning to the serpent, began to minse it with a <hi>peraduenture, Least peraduenture ye dye,</hi> when God <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Iunius in</hi> Gen. 3. 3.</note> absolutely and resolutely had saide, <hi>In dying ye shall dye.</hi> So they in <hi>Ieremy</hi> wicked &amp; impenitent wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches yet flatter themselues in hope of mercy, <hi>It may</hi>

               <p>THus wee haue seene how deceitfull our hearts <note place="margin">2. To God.</note> are in the promises they make to <hi>our selues:</hi> it remaineth to see the like deceitfulnes in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they make to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the heart is deceitfull in promising to God, either the duties of repentance, and reformation in <hi>generall,</hi> or any speciall dutie in speciall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>particular duties,</hi> how often do we purpose, <note place="margin">1. Duties par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, &amp; that either simply.</note> &amp; secretly, yea otherwhile more solemnly, promise to God the performance of this or that, when yet, in the end we do nothing lesse, by reason of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnesse, and vnsetlednesse of our deceiueable hearts. <hi>Salomon</hi> insinuates, that in his time there were some, that after, by vow they had bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Lord for the performance of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 25. Eccles. 5. 5.</note> did yet afterward go about to enquire for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, how to be discharged of their vow. <hi>Iakob</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and solemnly vowed to the Lord that, beeing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19272:138"/> blessed in his iourney, and safely returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he would build an altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> &amp; pay tithes. Neuerthlesse, for all this, <hi>Iakob</hi> after his return could sit still, and find no leysure to pay his vow, till God came, and plucked him by the eare, both by the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions sent vpon him in himselfe &amp; his children, and also by his owne voice, as it were shewing him the reason of his danger before by <hi>Esau,</hi> and now by the people of that country, of <hi>Dinahs</hi> rauishment, and his sonnes barbarous murther, <hi>Arise, go vp to Bethell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 35. 1.</note>
                  <hi>and build there an altar,</hi> according to thy vowe. How often doe the best purpose with themselues to shew some proofe of their spirituall grace, in performance of this or that dutie: when yet, when it comes to the triall, we are altogether disabled, and shew nothing but weaknesse and corruption? because we haue by our negligence and securitie greeued the spirit of God. Wherein it fareth with vs, as with <hi>Sampson,</hi> who said with himselfe, <hi>I will goe out now as at other</hi>

                  <hi>times, and shake my selfe, but hee knew not,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>that the spirit of the Lord was departed from him.</hi> And so his heart deceiued him. Thus was it <note place="margin">Psa. 39. 1. 2. 3.</note> with <hi>Dauid; I saide I will looke to my waies that I sinne not with my tongue, I will keepe my mouth bridled whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the wicked is in sight;</hi> but presently after he shews how soone he broke his word. <hi>My heart was hot, the fire kindled, and I spake with my tongue, &amp;c. Peters</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is very memorable; how confident was he in protesting and promising concerning his sticking to Christ, to the very death? but yet quickly plucked in <note place="margin">

                  </note> his snayles hornes, euen at the slight touching of a sillie wench. How soone saith <hi>Austen</hi> didst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19272:138"/> him as a dead man, whom before thou confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst as the liuing sonne of God?</p>
               <p>To this place belongeth that vsuall deceit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we secretly promise to the Lord the doing of this <note place="margin">Or on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō of getting this or that.</note> or that, when our present estate shall bee chaunged. Oh if J were thus, and thus, I would doe so and so. <hi>If I were King,</hi> saith <hi>Absalom, I would see iustice done to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man.</hi> Thinke we, he would haue beene as good as his worde, if euer he had beene King? Assuredly none would haue beene more tyrannical. If I were a rich man, saith one, O how liberall, how free-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should I be? God happely lets him haue <hi>his wish,</hi> but hee lets not God haue <hi>his promise.</hi> God giueth <hi>riches</hi> to him, but he no <hi>liberality to God.</hi> Nay when he is become rich, he is more vniust, niggardly, scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then those of whom hee complained before, when he was poore. Thus young men thinke with themselues, when they come to bee ould, they will not offend in those faults wherein they see age so much ouertaken, as frowardnesse, morositie, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, contempt of youth, &amp;c. Vnmarried persons thinke, when they are once married, they shall liue so louingly, and comfortably, and be quite free from all those faults which they see married folke to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in. Men without children, if once they might come to haue children, O the dueties they would performe, the care of godly education they would haue. Priuate men, if they were in places of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, O the wonders that they then would do. And in euery state and condition, whatsoeuer want wee see in others, wee dare promise touching our selues a freedome from it, if we were in it. But wee
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19272:139"/> know not, at least remember not, that euery state hath seuerall temptations, and burdens, annexed vnto it. And how can wee know, either how wee shall <hi>withstand</hi> the one, or <hi>stand vnder</hi> the other, till it come to the triall. Nay rather, we should feare the worse of our selues. Behold now, beeing poore, I am couetous, when I want that baite of feeling the sweete of gaine, which rich men haue. What then should I be, if I were rich, when the danger is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haue our harts stollen away by riches increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing? Behold now I am a single man, and haue no body to looke to but my selfe, and yet I finde I haue enough to do this well: how then shall I doe, when besides my selfe, I haue a familie to ouersee? Behold now I am a priuate man, &amp; haue no body, but mine owne family to gouerne: And yet I find my hands full with this. Alas! if I were in publike place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, how should I be ouercharged? Beholde being but a meane obscure person, I yet find it hard to humble and keepe vnder my proud heart. What should I doe then, if I flourished in worldly glorie, and were a great one in princes courts? lo I can hardly stand fast in firme ground. How then can I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my feete in slippery ground?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In promising to God repentance, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <note place="margin">2. general, of repentance.</note> in generall, the case is alike. Men in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and sicknesse, looking for death, how libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall are they in their promises? but afterward how basely niggardly are they in their performances? They play childrens play with God, they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a thing, as soone as they haue giuen it. When <note place="margin">Ier. 34. 10. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> besieged <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> then the <hi>Iewes</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:19272:139"/> made a solemne couenant with the Lord, to set free their seruants: But noe sooner had the King remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his siege, but they retracted, and repealed their vow, and brought backe againe their seruants into their former bondage. So fareth it with these kind of men. When God laies siege to them by sicknes or some other pinching affliction, then couenants, and promises are made concerning the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of our sinnes: But no sooner doth God begin to depart, and slake his wrath, but we returne with the dogge to the vomit, and with the sow to our wallowing in the mire. Like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that dismissed the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when death entred within his palaces, but presently after, in all hast, makes after them to fetch them backe againe. Thus was it in that great sweat in the time of king Edward. As longe (saies one) as the feruentnesse of the plague lasted, there was crying <hi>peccani, peccaui,</hi> mercy good lord, mercy, mercy. The ministers of gods word were sought for in euery corner, they could not rest, they might not sleepe: yee must come to my Lord, yee must come to my Lady, come if ye loue God, and if yee loue their saluation tary not. For Gods sake M. Minister (say the sicke folks) tell vs what we shal do to auoide Gods wrath. Take these bagges. Pay so much to such a man; for I deceiued him: giue him so much, for I gat it of him by vsury. I made a crafty bargaine with such a one, restore him so much and desire him to forgiue me. Diuide this bag among the poore, cary this to the hospitall, pray for mee for Gods sake, Good Lord forgiue me &amp;c. This was the dissimulation of the people for three or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19272:140"/> foure dayes whiles the execution was, but after when the rage was somewhat swaged, then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they to their vomit worse then euer they were. Then that they had before caused to bee restored, and giuen in almes they seeke to recouer by more euil-fauoured cheuisaunses. This deceitfulnesse God noted in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who being humbled with the terrors of the law, promised very largely, <hi>All these things will we doe.</hi> But what said God. <hi>O that there were such a heart,</hi> namely as, in this so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and franke a promise of obedience, they make show of, and at this time thinke indeed they haue. For now we speake of such a kinde of deceitfulnes, whereby we deceiue our selues as well as others. <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> We are not to thinke these <hi>Israelites</hi> did grossely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble with God: but at that time, being in some distresse, they spake as they thought, and meant to do. But by reason their heartes were not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie purged, and renewed, it was only a suddaine fit for the time, afterwardes their hearts returning to their old bias, they were not able to performe that which they promised. This the Scripture would teach, when it saieth <hi>their hearts started a side like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull bowe.</hi> When a man shoots with a deceitfull <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 57. explayned.</note> bowe, though he leuell his arrow, and his eye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the marke, and thinke with himselfe to hit it, yet indeed the arrow, by reason of his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bow, goes a cleane contrary way. Answerable to this bowe is our heart, to the arrowe the desires, purposes, and promises wee conceiue, and make in our afflictions. The marke wee ayme at is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To the which wee then looke with so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19272:140"/> and attentiue an eye; as though we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent indeed. And that indeed is our purpose, and meaning then: but our owne hearts deceiue vs. For, because they are not truly renewed, but there is much vnsoundnesse still in them, hence it comes to passe, that these arrowes of our purposes, and promises of repentance neuer hit the marke, neuer sort to any good effect, but vanish in the aire as smoake. <hi>Ahab</hi> did not grosly dissemble in that his humiliation wrought by the Prophets reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but he meant in good sadnesse, when he cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himselfe in sackcloth. Onely his heart still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vnregenerate, &amp; so deceiued him. So was it with <hi>Pharao</hi> also. One wold think that water heated in the fire were indeed as truley hotte as fire it selfe. But because it is not a naturall heate, but onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall from the heate of the fire, remooue it but a while from the fire, and it returnes againe to his owne nature, and as the Philosopher obserues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristot. meteor.</hi> 1. 12.</note> colder after the heating, then it was before. So is it with these flashings of deuotion &amp; holines, which were in <hi>Ahab, Pharaoh,</hi> and others in like case. They are not kindly, but violent, they are not from the inward fire of Gods spirit, but from the outward fire of his iudgements. And therefore when that is out, these are gone.</p>
               <p>And this is the third part of the hearts deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, namely its deceitfulnesse in promising. The vse of that which hath beene spoken hereof, is</p>
               <p n="1">1 To teach vs patience, when we are crossed in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>
                  </label> those things wee desired, and wherein we promised great faelicity to our selues. For God hee sawe the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19272:141"/> deceitfulnesse of our hearts in such promises, &amp; that indeed these things would in the euent haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>serpents,</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> which wee thought would haue been <hi>fishes,</hi> and <hi>bread,</hi> that they would haue been very bitter, and burdensome vnto vs, which we fancied as matters of comfort, and delight.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To rest contented in that estate wherein wee are. For howsoeuer wee promise much of our selues, if our estate should change for the better, as from pouerty to riches, from obscurity to glory, and greatnesse in the world, and presume of our owne strength, not to be touched with those infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that vsually attend such estates; yet we haue learned how deceitfull our hearts be herein. Haue we then a liberall, and mercifull affection in our po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uertie? let vs not be ouer desirous of a richer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For we know not whether then wee shall be of the same minde, yea or no. And that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we haue to liberality, while we are poore, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God for liberality it selfe. Take heede then of this deceit. Thou desirest to be <hi>rich,</hi> that thou mightest be <hi>liberall.</hi> So much thy heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth thee, that thou shouldest be very <hi>liberall,</hi> if thou wert once <hi>rich.</hi> Lo thou art <hi>liberal,</hi> before thou art <hi>rich,</hi> in regard of the <hi>affection,</hi> and disposition of thy heart, and when thou art <hi>rich,</hi> thou art not so much as liberall in <hi>affection.</hi> Thou doest not only not get that liberality in <hi>action,</hi> which thou promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst thy selfe in riches, but also thou leesest, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thy pouerty, that liberality in <hi>affection,</hi> which then thou haddest. O deceitfull heart, who by promising vs more, makest vs to haue lesse. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19272:141"/> then rather to keepe thy pouerty, that thou maiest keepe thy <hi>liberality;</hi> remembring that of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, that though <hi>that which a man should specially</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 19. 22. opened.</note>
                  <hi>desire is his goodnesse,</hi> that is, to do good in workes of liberality; yet <hi>a poore man,</hi> that, hauing nothing to giue, hath yet a giuing affection, <hi>is better then a lier;</hi> that is, as I take it, better then such a rich man, who before he was rich, would bragge much what hee would do, if he were rich, and yet, being rich, is poorer in liberality, then euer hee was: who is therefore, in regard of this deceitfulnesse of heart, worthily called a <hi>lyer</hi> by the holy Ghost. Be not then, through this deceitfulnesse, moued to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of an higher, and greater estate. <hi>If there bee a</hi>

Thou art a bad poore man: thou wouldest be a worse rich man. Thou art an ill gentleman: and is there any hope that thou wouldest be a better noble man? In pouerty, and meanenesse thou canst not be free from those infirmities, whereto that estate is subiect: and yet thinkest thou to escape those whereto riches, and honour lie open?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neuer to be ouer bolde, or lauish in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing much of our selues. Do we with the most: but speake wee with the least. For our heartes will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs. Wee would hardly giue our wordes for
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19272:142"/> a false knaue, that had often deceiued vs. Why then learne we not the like wisedome here, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise any great matters of our selues, since wee haue such deceiuing heartes, as will shame vs in the end, if we presume any thing far of them. It is a shame to vs, when others, of whom wee haue promised much vnto our friends, shall deceiue vs. Therefore the Apostle, hauing promised <hi>Titus</hi> no small things concerning the Corinthians, saith he was not <hi>asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 14. 16.</note>
                  <hi>in that whereof he had boasted of them vnto Titus,</hi> because their doings had abundantly iustified his sayings. Thereby insinuating, what a shame it would haue been vnto him, if the Corinthians had deceiued that hope, and confidence which he had of them. O then what a foule shame must it needs be, when our owne heartes shall deceiue vs in that which we haue promised of them to God? Suffer wee not then our tounges to runne ouer in this kinde, least it fare with vs, as with that same young man in the Gospell, who came running in all the hast to our Sauiour, crying out, <hi>Good master what</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 10. 17. 22.</note>
                  <hi>good thing must I doe to get eternall life;</hi> therein secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie promising, that he would be willing to doe any thing Christ should command him. For it is, as if he should haue said. O let me but know what is to be donne, &amp; be it what it wil be, lo here I am ready, prest to doe it. But when Christ told him what was to be done, <hi>Goe sell all, and giue to the poore &amp;c.</hi> then he slunke, and shrunke backe. For how many are there that, through this kind of deceitfulnesse, deale with God, as Horuah did with Naomi, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Ruth. 1. 10. 14.</note> her beleeue that nothing should be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19272:142"/> them, there was no ho, but she must needes follow Naomie into Iudea: but she was soone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to stay behind, and take her leaue. The Prophet Osea bringeth in the Israelites, renuing <note place="margin">Hos. 6. 1.</note> their couenant with the Lord, in very serious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Come let vs returne to the Lord &amp;c.</hi> One would thinke here were an excellent spirit of sincerity. But God, discerning guile in this their so hotte, and hasty zeale, passeth this sentence vppon it, <hi>What shall I doe vnto thee ô Ephraim &amp;c. All thy righteousnesse is as the morning dewe.</hi> And therefore when our harts promise any thing to God, whether openly, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, we must desire Gods strength to inable vs for performance, as <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing promised, <hi>I will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 8.</note>
                  <hi>keepe thy statutes,</hi> praieth, <hi>forsake me not ouer longe.</hi> Yea we must in this case deale with our hearts, as <hi>Iosua</hi> did with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> promising their seruice <note place="margin">Iosh. 24. 16. 17. 18. 19.</note> to the Lord, ô saies <hi>Iosua, yee cannot serue the Lord, he is a iealous God &amp;c:</hi> so we in like manner, must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our selues the difficulty of doinge any good thing: both in regard of our <hi>weakenesse,</hi> and <note place="margin">Pro. 6. 1.</note> Sathans <hi>wilinesse.</hi> And, as in being surety to man, for our brother, the scripture exhortes vs to be wel aduised what wee doe: so much more ought we to be heedefull, and considerate in this suretiship to God for such false hearts as these are, that weighing well our owne inability to do so much as the least good, wee may neuer presume to vndertake any such matter, otherwise then in the deniall of our selues, and in the earnest crauing of the presence of the spirit, without whom wee can neither promise, nor perfourme as we ought.</p>

               <p>NOw we are come to the fourth, and last head <note place="margin">4. In practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing where the</note> of the first kinde of the <hi>selfe-deceiuing</hi> of the heart, namely the deceitfulnesse which is in <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe.</hi> And this shewes it selfe in diuers particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The deceitfulnesse of heart in practising ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the <hi>ficklenesse</hi> and <hi>vncertainety</hi> thereof; <note place="margin">I. Deceit is in the hearts fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klenes in good</note> whereby it commeth to passe, that we cannot hold on a constant tenour in any good course, without making of many interruptions. Many begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into such, and such good waies of repentance, and reformation, but they soone grow weary, and breake off. <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> seeing the excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall spirit of <hi>Daniel</hi> in interpreting his dreame, was so affected, that only <hi>Daniels</hi> god must be the <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 47.</note> true God. And yet this lasted not long. For within a little while after, for all this, his Idole must bee worshipped vnder paines of death. And after this the sight of the miracle in the three childrens deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, <note place="margin">Chap. 3. 5.</note> that the fire, which was fire to burne the bondes wherewith they were tied, was no fire so much as to sindge their apparrell, how did it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke vpon him, and wring from him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the true God: yet, for all this, not long after we may see him ietting it in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and as proudly, as euer, aduauncing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe aboue the Lord. Neither is it thus only with the wicked, but in the godly also themselues, in the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19272:143"/> true practise of godlinesse, though not in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. whence it is, that they finde such vneuenesse in their liues, that they are so off, and on, so out, and in, now in good frame, but by and by sensibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered, and altogether vnlike themselues. Sometimes how are wee hoysed vp to the very skies, in abundance of pure, and heauenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and consolations, as it were rapt vp with <hi>Paul</hi> into paradise, or ascending in <hi>Elias</hi> fiery chariot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen? Otherwhile againe cast downe into the very deepes of hel, not able to pray, heare, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with any feeling of comfort. Sometimes in praier transformed in our soule (so are we rauished) as Christ was in body, when hee prayed. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while <note place="margin">Luc. 9. 29.</note> againe as heauie in praier, as the sleepie disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with Christ in the garden; the wings of our faith being clipt, our praiers lie groueling on the ground. Sometimes so comfortable, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that we can say with <hi>Dauid, Though I were in the valley of death, yet would I feare none ill:</hi> otherwhile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">Psalm. 23. 4.</note> so deaded, and deiected in our spirits, that we are like him, when he said, <hi>One day I shall die by the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 27. 1.</note>
                  <hi>hand of Saul.</hi> Sometimes so strong in faith, that we can ouercome the greatest dangers, and with <hi>Peter</hi> can walke vpon the swelling waues: By and by so faint, and brought to so low an ebbe that wee fall downe euen in farre lesser dangers; as <hi>Peter</hi> began to sinke at the rising of the winde. Sometimes so patient, that we can quietly beare the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities▪ presently after so impatient, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put vp the smallest vnkindnesses. As <hi>Dauid</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in <hi>Sauls</hi> persecution, impatient in <hi>Nabals</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curtesie.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19272:144"/> To conclude. In the hearing of the word, how doe wee feele sometimes our hearts to burne, and glowe within vs? O the heauenly affections we then feele inkindled! ô the sweete disposition, and frame our hearts bee in then! little would wee thinke then, that afterward we should be so much cooled, as we are very quickly after our departure from this fire, and comming into the friezing aire of the world. In which regard, as Chrysostome saies, the ministers haue the greater trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neuer finde their worke as they left it, as other workemen do, the smith, the ioiner, &amp;c. who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hom.</hi> 13. <hi>ad pop. Antioch.</hi>
                  </note> as they left their worke in the euening, so they find it in the morning: but ministers shall finde their worke altogether put out of frame, and order, by reason of our deceitfull heartes, that steale from vs those good affections wee had before. If a horse naturally trot and for some space of time hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed himselfe thereto, though by art he bee broken, and made amble, yet in journying he will be, euer and anon, offering to go out of his amble into his trot. So regenerate men, because naturally their hearts are euill, though in part mortified by grace, they haue learned to doe well, yet, euer and anon, they haue experience of the readines of their hearte to breake out into their ould courses. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in them will haue some flurtes. Our heart is the instrument wee must worke with, in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. But a deceitfull instrument will not hold out in working. No more will our deceitfull heart in the seruing of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second point</hi> of deceitfulnesse in this kind is in <note place="margin">II. Deceit, the slipperines in the very act of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</note>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:19272:144"/> the <hi>slipperinesse</hi> of our heartes; whereby it comes to passe, that they giue, both God, and our selues, the slippe, whilest they are in the performance of good exercises. As when in praier, meditation, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word they slily steale away, and play the fugitiues, caried away with idle, and wandring imaginations. This deceitfulnesse the most holy haue miserable experience of; their heartes herein dealing with them, as if our seruant imployed in some busines together with our selues, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the worke should priuily steale away, wee not marking, or minding of him. That holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Austen</hi> felt this, and bewailed it in himselfe, that in his most serious meditations of heauenly things his mind was easily distracted by the sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <note place="margin">Confess. 10. 35</note> occasions. Concerning the which hee thus writeth, <q>
                     <hi>Let euery</hi> man therfore marke and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">in psal. 86.</note> what doings there are within in the hart, how often times our praiers themselues are interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vaine thoughtes, so that our heart can hardly stand stil with God. Though yet it would lay hold on it selfe and so make it selfe to stay with him, yet in a sort it flieth away as it were from it selfe, neither can it finde any boundes wherby it may keep in it selfe from flying away in her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring motions, that so tarying still with the Lord it may be refreshed with sweete delights by him. Hardly among many of our praiers meet we with such a praier. Euery one would be ready to say that this were so only with him, and that others were not troubled in like manner, vnlesse we had heard Dauid in a certaine place saying, Therfore
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19272:145"/> thy seruant hath founde his heart to pray vnto <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 27. cleared by Austen. <hi>Dixit se inueni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re cor suū, quasi soleret fugere, &amp; ille sequi quasi fugitiuū, &amp; non compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendere, &amp; clamare ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, &amp;c.</hi> Psalm. 38.</note> thee.</q>
                  <hi>Lo he saies that he found his heart, as though his heart were wonte to flie away from him, and he faine to runne after this fugitiue, &amp; being not able to catch it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to cry to the Lord, my heart hath left me.</hi> So farre <hi>Austen,</hi> excellently seting forth this deceitfulnes of our hearts. Would we not count him a deceitfull friend, who, when we should haue greatest vse of him, would then be sure to be out of the way? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like deceitfull must our heartes needes be, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest instrument wherwith we are to serue the Lord. And yet when Gods seruice is to be performed of vs, our hearts are then to finde, they haue runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs, and so, when we should seeke God, we must first go seeke our selues.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third deceit</hi> is, when our heartes doe priuily, <note place="margin">III. Deceit, secret foisting in of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into good actions.</note> and secretly, we scarse perceiuing it, foist in, and closely conuaie some corruption into our good actions, euen then, when wee are in the very acte of performance. And with this deceit are euen the children of God themselues exceedingly troubled. For howsoeuer they propound not to themselues any of these by, and base respects of praise, and vaine glory &amp;c. in their good actions, but rather do set themselues against them; yet these things doe come in by stealth, and slily insinuate, and wind in themselues into their hearts, as once the serpent into the garden. So fitlie in this regarde doth the Prophet call our heart deceitfull, in that word, in the originall, from whence <hi>Iakob</hi> had his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our fleshly hearts do the same thing to the spirit, in doing of good, which <hi>Iakob</hi> did to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19272:145"/> comming out of the wombe, as it were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it, and catch it by the heele, when it is in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Christian race; for what els doe they, when they intrude, and obtrude vpon vs their own carnall, and corrupt affections? looke how those <hi>Samaritanes</hi> would haue had their finger in the building of the temple with the Iewes, namelie with a purpose to haue destroyed it; and looke how <hi>Iehu</hi> offered sacrifice to <hi>Baal,</hi> killing his priests at the same time: and looke how <hi>Hushai</hi> went to <hi>Absaloms</hi> company to ouerthrow him. A like deale our harts with vs, needes will they intermeddle in our good actions, but it is but to rob vs of them, by transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them into sin, through the mixture of their corruption. For when there springs vp any sweete fountaines of grace within vs, then doe they close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as once the <hi>Philistims</hi> dealt with <hi>Isacks</hi> welles, which he had digged) cast in their filthy dirt, and dust, and stop them vp therewith. They droppe downe from their impure hands some filth, vpon that pure webbe the spirit weaueth, and so make it a monstruous cloath. They cunningly put in their leauen into the spirits dough, and so sowre it, and make it distastfull to the Lord. When sometime the spirit of grace is offering to put forth it selfe, as once <hi>Zarah</hi> in <hi>Thamars</hi> wombe, yet, by reason of this deceitfulnesse of our hearts, it recoyles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and goes backe, so as <hi>Zarah</hi> did, and the flesh like Perez, that steppes before it; and so as they were deceiued, when <hi>Zarahs</hi> hand was first seene, so wee often, when we feele our selues making some offers towards God.

                  </note> through the deceitfulnesse of his heart, euen then, whilest he was exhorting them to chastity, some vnchast motions might come creeping into his owne heart, and steale vpon him vnawares. And so in preaching, while the minister is stirring vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the zeale of gods glory, through this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse of heart, it comes to passe, too often, that thoughtes of pride, and vaine glory poppe in themselues, to defile, and deface the glory of the worke. In which regard <hi>Austen</hi> saies, that it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to preach holily, then to heare, writing vpon that of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Thou shalt make me to heare the voyce of ioy, and gladnesse, which he reades some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">In Psal. 50.</note> otherwise, thus.

The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">Faeliciores sunt qui audiunt &amp;c.</note> of the word are more happy then the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. The learning hearer may be humble. But the speaker he must striue against pride, and the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19272:146"/> desire of pleasing men, that they closly creep not in vpon him, and <hi>cause him to displease God,</hi> &amp;c.</q> The like deceit are we subiect vnto in prayer also. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>Ionahs</hi> example, of whom it is said, that he then <note place="margin">Ionah. 4. 2.</note> prayed, when indeed he did nothing but quarrell with God. Read the wordes of that his praier, and yee shall finde nothing prayer-like in them. They seeme rather to be a braule, then a praier. How then is he said to pray? No doubt feeling his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in giuing place to anger, he thought to striue against it, and in this good minde addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to praier: but yet, loe the deceitfulnesse of his heart, while by prayer hee thought to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his anger, anger ouer came him and his praier too, turning it into a jangling, and wrangling expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation with the Lord. Thus otherwhile men setting themselues to meditate against some sinne, in the very acte of meditation haue been insnared therein. For as in speaking against some sinnes, it falles out that others sometime are taught to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise them, (which was <hi>Solons</hi> reason of making no-lawes against the killing of our parents, least by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding it he should teach it) so also in thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some sinnes, our selues may be caught. And when men in their thoughtes haue beene framing their mindes to reconciliation with their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in the remembrance of the iniurie receiued they haue been further incensed, then before. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did well to aske the question, <hi>Maister shad we draw</hi>

                  <hi>the sword.</hi> He did not aske this question as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> whether they should go downe into <note place="margin">Ier. 42.</note> Aegypt, being before resolued to go downe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19272:147"/> the Prophet should answere. No, we are not to thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> had made a resolute answere to his question before he made it, being fully purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to draw, before he asked the question. No, he did not so fouly dissemble. But in asking the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion he seemed to bee framing his mind to more moderation, and willing to be aduised, &amp; directed by Christ, but yet withall exasperated with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency of the aduersary, and indignity of the fact, he could not hold his minde in that temper of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to stay the answer of the question, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in asking drew, the deceitfulnesse of his hearte preuenting Christs answer. So againe oftentimes in many of our actions, where we thinke we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a good end, and doe indeed in some sort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, there yet withall, vnder hand, gets into our mindes the consideration of some other sinister, and crooked respect. As <hi>Moses</hi> pretended to the Lord, that the conscience of his owne weakenesse, and insufficiency made him so fearefull of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the office he imposed vpon him, least by this meanes Gods glory should be foiled in him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he altogether dissemble therein. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all there secretly lurked another matter beside the feare of himselfe, namely the feare of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> least he would haue reuenged the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> quarrell vpon him. And therefore God seeing that, said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Arise Moses, go thy waies, they are dead that seeke thy life.</hi> So when we desire that our children, or others vnder our charge, should thriue in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, this is a good desire; but how often doe the eies of our mindes looke a squint at Gods glory
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19272:147"/> heerein; and (whatsoeuer our own pretences &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits may be) like <hi>Demetrius</hi> pretending <hi>Dianaes</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, when yet it was his owne gaine he more specially intended, how often are we <note place="margin">Acts 19. 27.</note> carried away with a respect of our selues, that wee might reape some credit, in the good successe of our labours? And therfore excellently the Apostle, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himselfe of this corruption, writeth thus vnto the Corinthians. <hi>Now I pray to God that ye do no euill.</hi> The Corinthians might obiect. Thou thus prayest <note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 7.</note> not so much for our good, as for the credit of thine owne ministery. The Apostle therefore by way of preuention addes, <hi>not that wee should seeme approued,</hi> hauing our labours thus blessed: <hi>but that ye should do that which is honest, though wee bee as reprobates;</hi> in an honest desire of your owne good doe wee desire it, without any respect of our selues. Againe, when the children of God are humbled and cast downe in godly sorrow for their smaller sinnes, often vpon this occasion, the heart beginneth to conceiue thoughts of pride, O there are few that take notice of such small sinnes, or are so touched for them, as I. And so the theefe pride, steales away our humilitie, as it doth also all our other graces, it beeing almost all one to be simplie proud as to be proud because of our humility, to be vncleane, as to bee proud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our chastitie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth deceit</hi> of the hart in practising is, when <note place="margin">IV. Deceit, leaping from extreame to extreame.</note> it causeth vs to leape from one extreame to another, passing by the meane; as from prodigalitie, to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, from couetousnesse to prodigality, skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer liberality. In the former leape the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19272:148"/> man hath a fair pretence, O why should I wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mispend Gods creatures? why should I make my belly my God? But why dost thou not rightly vse Gods creatures? why doest thou make thy mony thy God? The prodigall, lately couetous, his colour is as good, why should I make my selfe a drudge to my goods? yea and why shouldest thou make thy selfe a drudge to thy pleasures. In the same kind of deceit are some brought from presumption to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, from thinking their sinnes are nothing, and that they can repent when they list for them, to thinke that they are greater then that euer they can repent, or find mercy at Gods hands. By the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit are men come from too much honouring of ministers, which was in Poperie, to too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of them. As it was in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, some would giue too much to the ministers, seruilely apprentising their iudgements vnto them, <hi>I am Pauls, I am Apolloes.</hi> Another sort, to auoide <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 12.</note> this extremity on the right hand, went as farre out on the left, in the vtter reiecting of the ministery, <hi>I am Christs,</hi> I care not for any minister, but will bee taught immediatelie by Christ himselfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> after hee had refuted those offending in the excesse, least anie through this deceitfulnesse should decline too much to the defect, hee wisely qualifies the matter, <hi>Let a man yet thinke of vs as of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 1.</note>
                  <hi>the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God.</hi> Let no man think that there is no way to auoid too much dignifying the ministers, then too much nullifying of them. This is like the husbandmans error, when in correcting the crookednes of a twig,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19272:148"/> hee writhes it too much the other way. A deceit, that befell the Fathers, who in their zealous dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of heresies, haue in their disputations ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot themselues, sometimes, and gone too farre on the other side. As <hi>Clemens</hi> was so farre carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst worship of images, that hee condemned the Art of painting. An example of deceit in this kind we haue in <hi>Peter,</hi> who for not suffering Christ to wash his feete, hearing that fearefull answer, <hi>Vnlesse</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 9.</note>
                  <hi>I wash thee, thou hast no part in mee,</hi> lashed out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently as farre the other way, <hi>Lord not feete onely, but hands, and head and all.</hi> But it was his feet only that Christ would wash, not his hands, or head. So the Corinthians, being reprehended for their remisnes, and careles ouersight, in not punishing the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person, fell to ouer-rigorous seuerity, in not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from punishment, in not loosing him vpon his repentance. So S. <hi>Austen</hi> confesseth of himselfe <note place="margin">

The errour in the primitiue Church was, to magnifie the Apostles writings in contempt of their vocall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. <hi>The letters,</hi> said the false Apostles concerning <hi>Paul, are sore and strong: but his bodily presence, and his speech is of no value.</hi> The Papists at this day haue auoided this errour, by falling into the contrary, of aduancing the doctrine, which the Apostles, say they, deliuered by word of mouth, their vnwritten verities, to the shamefull disparagement of their written doctrine. And to conclude, how many of vs, through this deceit, haue beene brought from
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19272:149"/> Popish superstition, to prophane and irreligious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme? From the blind zeale without knowledge, to a colde and hartlesse knowledge without zeale, from workes without faith, to faith without workes, from shaking off the yoke of that Romane tyranny, to shake off the sweete and easie yoke of Christ too, and so to an ouer licentious, and lawlesse dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. From the leauing of Popish fasting, pennance, confession, to the contempt of true Christian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, repentance, confession, and from the errour of the merit of good workes, to a shamefull neglect of them. So that we did more good workes (I meane outwardly in regard of the matter) in Poperie, for our owne glory, then now wee doe for Gods glorie, though Gods glory should bee a far more powerfull attractiue to good works then our owne. And these be the four first deceites in this kinde.</p>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our hearts deale with vs, as the Diuel would haue dealt with our Sauiour, when vpon occasion of his strong faith in his Fathers prouidence, which he had shewed, in resisting his first temptation, chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue by this faith in want of bread, then vpon his motion to commād the stones to be made bread, when, I say, vpon this occasion, he would haue cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly brought him on in his second temptation, to presumption, in casting himselfe downe headlong from the toppe of the pinacle, as beeing an action, which would carie a great colour of a very strong faith indeede <hi>Peter</hi> hauing made a notable profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his faith, <hi>Thou art the Christ, the sonne of the liuing God,</hi> and beeing therefore much commended by our Sauiour, presently thereupon tooke occasion to fall from the <hi>true boldnesse</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> to the <hi>sawcines</hi> of <hi>presumption,</hi> in aduising his Master to decline the crosse, whereupon the saluation of all the elect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. So likewise from iust &amp; lawfull zeale, how easily through this deceitfulnesse, do wee stray into blind boldnes, and vnaduisednesse? as the common people of their owne heads throwing downe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the Brownists as they call them, in separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19272:150"/> from our Churches; the like was the zeal of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in drawing out his sword, in his masters quarrell, and cutting off <hi>Malchies</hi> eare: as also of two of his fellowes, calling down for fire from heauen, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the inhospitall Samaritanes. In all these zeale degenerated, and became like wine turned into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger. As also in the Israelites, when thy were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so farre in their zeale and indignation against the <note place="margin">Iudg. 21. 1.</note> Beniamites that they sware rashly they would none of them giue any of their daughters to wife to a Beniaminite. So should a whole tribe haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and the Church and common wealth haue beene weakened and impaired. What madnesse was this in punishing others, so farre to exceed that therein also wee should punish our selues? Like the hands and other outward parts in the parable, which denying to minister foode to the bellie, because as they said it was idle and lazie while they laboured, did thereby pine and consume themselues. And yet to this did the deceitfull harts of the Israelites bring them vpon occasion of their iust and lawfull zeale. So easily may the Diuell cast in his wilde-fire into this fire of Zeale. Thus from the iust reuerence of holy men came in religious adoration; as wee may see in the examples of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> rebuked by <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Angell. So also, from godly sorrow how easily doe our deceitfull hearts carrie vs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and excessiue pensiuenesse, from beeing <hi>poore in spirit</hi> to be <hi>desperate in spirit.</hi> As the Apostle sheweth, admonishing the Corinthians, that they would comfort the incestuous sinner, and release him of his excommunication, least hee should vpon
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19272:150"/> occasion of longer continuance in his iust sorrow, be swallowed vp of despaire. <hi>For wee are not ignorant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 11.</note> saies the Apostle, <hi>of Sathans wiles,</hi> namely how hee laboureth to bring vs from the iust meane to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. And as it is Sathans, so also is it one of our owne hearts deceits; his deceits, by our consenting being made ours, as I shewed in the beginning. Thus from the true practise of mortification, in taming &amp; keeping vnder our flesh by abstinence, many haue brought thēselues to too great an austeritie &amp; seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Hence the whippings, and such like exercises of the Papists. Hence the discipline that hath bene vsed in monasteries, and the practise of some, that would neuer eat but running, least they should feele some pleasure, and delight in eating. <hi>Timothy</hi> was caught in this errour, when vnder the colour of abstinence, for the reproouing of the luxurious <hi>Ephesians,</hi> he had <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 23.</note> so farre macerated his body, that the Apostle was faine to prescribe him Phisicke. This may teach vs what an eye we had neede haue ouer our selues, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the practise of the best things, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more easie, by reason of the deceitfulnesse of our harts, then to mixe something of the extreames with the meane; so that wee can hardly bee angry without sinning, beleeue without presuming, repent without despairing, fear without doubting, be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without vaine lightnesse, bee sad without heauy and vnprofitable dumpishnes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> deceit is, when we incroach vpon God <note place="margin">VI.

Of all which, God indeed hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs the vse, yet not so, but hee hath confined vs within certaine limits, and as vnto the sea, hath set vs our bounds, saying: <hi>Thus farre shalt thou goe, and no farther.</hi> Now our deceitfull hearts hauing once gotten this by the ende, that such and such things are indifferent, and so may lawfully be done, thinke they are then on a sure ground, and so care not how farre they lash out; as though there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint in the vse of things indifferent. And thus it is strange to see, how that which is lawfull drawes on that which is not conuenient, yea and what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinnes are swallowed downe vnder the name of things indifferent. Come to a swinish Epicure, that makes his belly his God, and tell him of his abuse of Gods creatures: he will answer presently; why strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you my liberty in the vse of the creatures, which Christ hath purchased for me? Hath not God giuen vs <hi>wine to make glad the heart?</hi> Yes to make <hi>glad:</hi> but drunkennesse and surfeting makes it heauy. <hi>Take</hi>

                  <hi>with surfeting and drunkennesse.</hi> Thus wee see how easily our deceitfull hearts remooue the auncient <note place="margin">Prou. 23. 10.</note> bounds set by God, which to do, but with men, is a deceit not to be suffered. And so it steales on further till at length it bring vs from <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> to a most <hi>vnchristian libertinisme,</hi> and <hi>luxurious licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> Behold then heere a noble deceit, while men thinke they take and vse their liberty, indeede they loose it. For in the vse of these things, wherein God hath made them free men, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bondmen, beeing <hi>brought vnder the power</hi> of those things which they vse, as the Apostle elegantly speaketh. For they so inthrall themselues to the lust of their senses, and of their bellies, that though their owne, and others destruction be sometimes ioyned with the vse of some of these things, they cannot yet forbeare. Which seemed to bee the fault of some of the Corinthians, couering their intemperancy, and loue of their bellies, whereby they hazarded some of their brethrens soules, with the pretence of Christian liberty. So much the Apostle not obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates, when vnto that deceitfull obiection, <hi>All things are lawfull,</hi> he frameth this answere, <hi>But I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 12.</note>
                  <hi>will not be brought vnder the power of any thing.</hi> I will not make my selfe a slaue to my bellie, whose Lorde I should bee. So also God hath giuen vs liberty to deale in the world, and worldly occasions. But here, an inch beeing giuen, wee take an ell, rushing our selues ouer head and eares in them, to the preiudice of faith in Gods prouidence, and of the exercises of piety. So God hath giuen this liberty to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to take of their flockes sufficient maintenance.

                     <hi>Confes.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Crapula nonnū. quam subrepit seruo tuo.</hi>
                  </note> heere. <hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>drunkennesse is farre from mee; let it not once come neere me: As for gluttony, it steales somtimes vpon thy seruant. I pray thee remooue it farre from me. But who is there that sometimes is not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away beyond the measure of temperancy?</hi> Thus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, because of the lawfulnesse of naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fall to cockering of their children. In all these &amp; such like cases, we must be as ielous of our selues, as <hi>Iob</hi> was of his children in feasting. For heere the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is so much the more easie, by how much our suspition of it is the lesse, presuming vpon the law fulnesse. But we must oppose to this deceit that of the Apostle, <hi>All things are lawfull, but all things are not expedient.</hi> Circumstances of time, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must bee considered. Otherwise that saying is true. <hi>He that will doe all lawfull things,</hi> all that hee <note place="margin">Clem.</note> may, <hi>will quickly come to doe vnlawfull things,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he may not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>seuenth deceit</hi> is, when vpon some care of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">VII Deceit, Iusteling out a greater good by a lesse.</note> a lesser good, we iustle out the greater, and that oftentimes when it is most seasonable. <hi>Martha</hi> was
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19272:152"/> thus deceiued, when her care of performing one good dutie, in giuing the best, and most respectfull intertainement to Christ, shee could, deteined her from the hearing of the worde, a matter of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment. Thus many, that read not all the week long, knowing yet that reading is a dutie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, will therefore bee reading of the Scriptures in the sermon time, at the Church. Some also are at home in their priuate prayers, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, when the Church is assembled together, &amp; with priuate seruice exclude the publique. Others in hearing of the worde, while they minde the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and order of the preacher, &amp; matters of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they neglect that which concernes affection. And diuers such like. Heere remember, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in euill things, that rule be false, <hi>of euils choose the least,</hi> yet in good things the contrary is true, <hi>Of goods choose the greatest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>eigth deceit</hi> is, when hauing performed some <note place="margin">VIII. Deceit, After successe good to grow secure.</note> good seruice to God, we thereupon take occasion to be the more carelesse and secure. Like boyes, who after they haue followed their bookes hard in the schoole, thinke then they are priuiledged to sport &amp; play reakes. So is it with vs. Wee may easily feele this disposition in our selues, to bee ready to please our selues in vnlawfull liberties, when we haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord in lawfull duties. We may see it in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> after his embassage faithfully discharged to the Niniuites, breaking foorth into anger against the Lord: and in <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> after his notable seruice, both of prayer in sicknesse, and of thanksgiuing after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, fowly ouershooting himselfe in a vaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19272:153"/> of his treasures to the Babilonish Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour. Therefore, after a lightning take heed of a foyle. Neuer haue wee greater cause to tremble, then after wee haue well acquitted our selues in the performāce of some good duty. Thē wil our harts be seeking of vnlawful liberty, &amp; offring to steale away from God, that after their paines in his seruice they might refresh themselues with some pleasure of sin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ninth deceit</hi> is, when the flesh doth peruersly imitate the spirit in vs; when, as the Diuell transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">IX. Deceit, The fleshes peruerse imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the spirit.</note> himselfe into an Angell of light, so our fleshly and corrupt hearts into the similitude of spirituall, &amp; renewed. How is this? Specially in the raising vp of many good, and holy motions, meditations, desires, and affections in our minds. For example, otherwile in prayer, or in hearing of the word, there come into our minds, such, and such thoughts, and good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of doing this or that good worke; sometimes also many good affections, as of greefe for our sins, and such like, which yet are nothing to our present, either praying or hearing. Heere our deceitful harts will be ready to thinke these come from the spirit of grace; but the trueth is they come from our owne carnall hearts, and the Diuell together, both mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conspiring to deceiue vs. For the spirit of God hath no such office to draw away mens minds from hearing the worde. No, it openeth the hart, it boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth through the eares thereof, and maketh vs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. So the spirit of God hath nosuch office: neither as to trouble mens minds in praier with thoughts impertinent. No, the spirit is the spirit of prayer, and chaseth away all stragling thoughts, and keepeth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19272:153"/> our mindes steddy, and attentiue in prayer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assure thy selfe, heere is noble iugling. These thoughts suggested, though in themselues Diuine, yet the spirit that suggests them in this fashion, is not diuine, but fleshly, or diabolicall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>tenth deceit</hi> is, when in temptation our hearts betray vs, like <hi>Iudases,</hi> into the diuell hands. If one <note place="margin">X Deceit, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in temptation.</note> liuing familiarly with vs, so that wee reposed some trust in him, should yet, walking abroad with vs, and seeing some enemy come to offer violence, run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs, would wee not account him a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person? much more if hee should conspire with the enemy, and take his part against vs. So is it heere with our hearts, that lye continually in our bosomes, and pretend great kindnesse, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, no sooner yet can the Diuell set vpon vs with any temptation, but they forsake vs, yea they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs vp into his hands. Heerein dealing with vs as the false hearted men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would haue done with <hi>Dauid.</hi> As <hi>Dauid</hi> mistrusted them, so should we these hearts. Wee need not to aske the question, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did of the men of Keilah, <hi>Will they deliuer vs?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 23. 11.</note> Wee may assure our selues they will. Such is the depth of their falshood. <hi>Iudah</hi> when he went out in the morning to the sheepe-shearing, had no such purpose, as to commit incest with <hi>Thamar,</hi> but yet for all that being tempted, see how his owne heart deceiued him, and gaue him the slippe, yea thrust him into the hands of the temptation. And alas! who sees not this falsenesse of his owne heart, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then when wee goe forth into the world with a purpose against such and such sinnes? yet no sooner
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19272:154"/> are the least rising and tempting occasions offered to our eies, eares, or other senses, but wee are caught presently.</p>
               <p>The <hi>eleuenth</hi> deceit is, by holding vs occupied in thinking of some good thing to come, to make vs <note place="margin">XI. Deceit, by minding fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good to neglect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. 1. Sam. 10. 7.</note> neglect our present dutie. Heere we should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that saying of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul, When this shall come to passe,</hi> namely thy kingdome, <hi>doe that which comes next hand.</hi> It is a folly to leaue certainties for vncertainties. Thou hast certainty of that which is present. If thou wilt lay holde vpon the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thou maist. But as for that which is to come, thou art wholly vncertaine, thou knowest not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there will euer be any occasion of good for thee to lay holde of, or no. Heerein mee thinkes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our heart is like the practise of <hi>Tobiah,</hi> &amp; <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi> against <hi>Nehemie,</hi> who would haue drawen him away from the repairing of the citie by calling him to conference, and consultation with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 2. 7.</note> so our harts do often diuert vs from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of many good purposes, by casting other odde impertinent matters in our way, like as in a case farre vnlike the Philistimes diuerted <hi>Soul</hi> from the pursuit of <hi>Dauid,</hi> or as the foxe diuerts the hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sometimes from following the hare. But in this case we must be wise to answer our hearts, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> did his crafty aduersaries, <hi>I haue a great worke to doe, and I cannot come downe, why should the worke cease, while I leaue it, and come to you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>twelfth deceit</hi> is, when admittance being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">XII. Deceit, Perking of the handmaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.</note> for somthing, because of some other thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it should wait, as a handmaide on her mistresse,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19272:154"/> yet this handmaid beginneth to perke aboue her mistresse, and to incroach and vsurpe vpon the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest place. <hi>Austen</hi> shewes this deceit in himselfe in his sensuall delighting in singing of Psalms, in regard of the sweetnesse of the sound, and contentment of his eares therein. Of which he thus writeth. <hi>But of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the delight of my eare deceiueth mee, whiles</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confess.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Sed delectatio carnis mea saepè me fallit, dum rationem sensus non ita comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, vt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter posterior sit, sed tantum quia propter il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam meruit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti, etiam pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere ac du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conatur. Ita in his non sentiens, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>sense does not so follow reason, that it can patiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to come behind it, but hauing gotten to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onely because of it, would therefore go before and haue the chiefty. So I sin in these things not perceiuing it: but afterward, I perceiue it.</hi> The naturall delight in singing of Psalms is lawfull if it be subordinate, and subseruient to the spirituall delight in the matter it selfe. But heere was <hi>Austens</hi> deceit, that the <hi>naturall</hi> delight, in the <hi>sound,</hi> did ouertop the <hi>spiritual</hi> delight in the <hi>substance</hi> of the Psalme. So it is lawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the witty speeches that are in sermons, so we vse this our delight in the <hi>witte,</hi> to confirme our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the <hi>grace</hi> of the same speeches. But heere is the deceitfulnesse of our hearts, that our affection to the <hi>witte</hi> is farre more intense then to the <hi>grace,</hi> and that in affecting the witte of a sermon, we feele our affection to the grace somthing slaked and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This is as if one who is welcome to a place, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he is in my company, and comes as my shadow, should yet, after he were receiued into the house for my sake, cause my friend to thrust mee out of the doores, that he may haue all the welcome, &amp; kinde intertainment alone.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the deceit of our affections in generall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEtherto▪ we haue spoken of that deceitfulnesse of heart, which is <hi>ioyntly</hi> in the mind, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: <note place="margin">Deceit of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions alone.</note> it remaineth now, that we speake of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse of the affections, <hi>by themselues.</hi> Where first, wee will speake of their deceit in <hi>generall,</hi> and then secondly in <hi>speciall</hi> of the deceit of some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affections.</p>
               <p>The deceit of the affections in generall, shewes it <note place="margin">Generall, in their</note> selfe in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that they are of so variable &amp; mutable a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <note place="margin">1. Variablenes</note> that the face of the heuens is not so diuers, nor the sea or wether so inconstant, nor the Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon so changeable, as they. Nothing is there so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staied, nothing so vncertaine; not only changed this day from yesterday; but this houre, yea this moment from the former. Hence that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> No man knoweth loue or hatred, that is, as <hi>Iunius</hi> expounds <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 1. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</note> it, the thing either he loues, or hates, by reason of this sicklenesse of our, so easily alterable, affections. Who wold haue thought, that <hi>Ammons</hi> so hot affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his sister, could euer haue beene cooled. Yet, for all that, presently after his lust was satisfied, his hatred of her exceeded his former loue. Who would haue thought that the Iewes, that cryed <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna</hi> to Christ, would after haue cried so soon, <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, crucifie?</hi> Who would haue thought the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians so desirous of the Israelites departure, that they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19272:155"/> euen woed them to be gonne, by giuing them their pretious iewels, should yet, within so few houres, on the suddaine runne after them, to recouer them againe into their handes, as before. So for ioy, and sorrow we may see the like varieties, and changes. <hi>Ionas,</hi> that to day is the only merry man, while the gourd flourisheth, to morrowe, when it perisheth, none so pensiue, or perplexed as he.</p>
               <p>This deceit of our affections is most dangerous in the matters of religion; when we begin to wax cold, hauing been once zealous, and to eate vp that zeale of gods house, which was wont to eate vp vs. Thus was it with <hi>Ephesus,</hi> charged by Christ with <note place="margin">Reuel. 2. 4.</note> the losse of her first loue; and with the Galathians, that at the first were so feruent in their affections, that they could haue found in their hearts to haue plucked out their eyes for him; yet afterward were <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> more ready to plucke out his eyes. Thus also fared it with the Iewes, who at the first followed, and flocked after the Baptist, and reioyced in his light, but yet <hi>for a season</hi> only. <hi>Iohn</hi> quickly grew stale to them, and, as our Sauiour insinuates, no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 35.</note> of then <hi>a reede shaken with the winde.</hi> And <note place="margin">Math. 11. 7.</note> would to God the case were not alike with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in these our dayes.</p>
               <p>The second thing wherein our affections shew <note place="margin">2. Corrupting of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> themselues deceitfull, is in the blinding, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of our iudgement. These are our Eues, that do deceiue vs. <hi>Adam,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 14.</note>
                  <hi>not deceiued,</hi> that is, so much by his judgement, (though also by that too) as by his affections to his wife, which at length blinded his judgement. True
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19272:156"/> it is, our judgements should gouerne our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Adam</hi> should haue donne <hi>Eue,</hi> yet thus it falleth out, that affection ouerrules, and ouer-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades judgement. We see how our affections to our children, kinred, and speciall friends, do oftens dazle our eyes, that we maintaine errour, &amp; wrong. As <hi>Barnabas</hi> may seeme to haue donne against <hi>Paul</hi> in his so stiffe standing out against him in the case of <hi>Marke,</hi> who was his kinsman, as appeares <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4. 10. How often haue errours been entertained, because of our affections to those that bring, and broach them? Hence that fetch of heretiques, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> first to <hi>perswade,</hi> then to <hi>teach,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prius suader<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whereas the truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, <note place="margin">Veritas docendo suadet, non suadendo docet.</note> doth perswade by teaching, not teach by persuading. Contrarily many wholesome trueths haue beene distasted, only by reason of the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which our naughty affections haue conceiued against the teachers; As in the example of <hi>Ahab,</hi> refusing <hi>Micaiahs</hi> prophesie. Againe, whats the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that so many wise, and learned men in the Church of Rome haue been, and still are so grosly seduced with such foppish, and senselesse errours? Euen this, their owne affection to gaine, and glory, and those other alluring giftes, which that strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet hath in her hand, which they cannot receiue, vnlesse they first take her poysoned cup, and drinke thereof. <hi>Reward blindeth the eies of the wise;</hi> that is <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 19.</note> our corrupt affection towards reward. When once
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19272:156"/> the affection is set vpon gaine, then presently gaine is godlinesse, and if a thing be gainfull, then though neuer so vile, it shall be coloured ouer as good, and lawfull. Our affections, when they would haue a thing, sharpen our wittes, and set them on worke, to deuise argumentes to serue their turne. But suspect we alwaies our iudgements (though they may seeme neuer so well fortified with reasons) in those cases wherein our affections are interessed. Surely our affections wil plead mightily, and deale craftily, raising vp fogges, and mistes before our eyes, and setting false colours vpon things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs. Looke how in a greene glasse all thinges seeme greene, and as to an aguish tast all thinges bitter; so when the judgement is distempered by affection, all things shalbe judged of according to the pleasure of affection. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> wel saies. Of these corrupt lustes, that they <hi>fight against the soule,</hi> yea euen the principall part thereof, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note> by making it seruilely to frame it judgement to their desire. We ordinarily see the deceit of our affections in naturall thinges▪ Fathers thinke their owne children the wisest, and the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. So louers their loues. The ape thinketh his owne brats though ougly, and mishapen, to bee faire, and beautifull. Assuredly these affections of ours are no lesse deceitfull in things spirituall. The vilest deformities, if once they bee affections dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, shalbe accounted comely ornaments. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say what they will. The affections haue taken captiue the vnderstanding, and <hi>Delilah</hi> hath lulled <hi>Samson</hi> a sleepe. The bellie hath no eares, nor yet

               </argument>
               <p>NOw to come to the deceit of some particular affections. And first to begin with <hi>loue.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The deceit of the affection of loue is, when we <note place="margin">1. Loue. The deceit.</note> thinke we loue mens persons, as they are gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; his new creatures in Christ; when yet indeed wee loue not their <hi>persons,</hi> but their riches, honours, reputation in the world, and such like <hi>adioints</hi> of their persons. In louing of our selues, we prefer our persons before our goods, or ought els; as the Diuell obserued, <hi>Skinne for skinne, and all that a man hath, will he giue for his life.</hi> Now the law is, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> And so we should loue him, and not his. But quite contrary is it with many of vs in the louing of others. Wee prefer their purses, and portions, before their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Whatsoeuer wee may persuade our selues, the truth is, that wee loue specially in them these outward thinges, and know them according to the flesh. The discouery of this deceit is in the change <note place="margin">The Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thereof.</note> of estate.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When riches are turned into pouerty, honour into ignominy; if then we leaue our friend, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we loued not his person before. For that is still the same, his piety, his partes are the same, that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:19272:157"/> when he was rich, happily more. When the corne is spent, the rattes leaue the barne, and yet the roome is the same. It was not then the roome they loued. Here was the triall of the sincerity of <hi>Iohns</hi> loue to our Sauiour, that hee forsooke him not on the crosse, as his fellowes did. For indeede Christ was the same on the crosse, that in the pulpit, in the temple, Christ suffering was the same, that he was working miracles. Thus was the deceitfull loue of many professours at <hi>Rome</hi> towards <hi>Paul</hi> discouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that they stood not to him when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented before Nero. Heerein also appeared some vnsoundnesse in <hi>Iobs</hi> wife hir loue, when she began to loath him because of his boyles, and botches. If she had loued his grace, <hi>botchy Iob</hi> and <hi>poore Iob</hi> was as gracious, as <hi>haile Iob,</hi> and <hi>rich Iob.</hi> The like may be said of their loue, who depending vppon him in his flourishing estate, afterward dispised him <note place="margin">Iob. 30. 1.</note> in his fall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When also our estate is changed from worse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to a better, here also is a discouery of deceitfull loue. For as in the former change vnsounde loue will turne into <hi>hatred,</hi> so in this into <hi>enuie.</hi> Here was the discouery of <hi>Sauls</hi> false heart to <hi>Dauid,</hi> when, seeming to loue him deerely, and intirely before, he could not yet indure him, when he saw him grow greater then himselfe, and heard his <hi>ten thousands</hi> and but his owne <hi>thousands.</hi> And here was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble triall of the sincerity of <hi>Ionathans</hi> loue to <hi>Dauid,</hi> when, for all hee knew hee was to be preferd to the kingdome, and so the only man to put him by that dignity, yet still hee continued constant in loue.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:19272:158"/> Whereas, if he had loued him only for outwarde respects, as because of the similitude of their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, that he was a man of a Martiall spirit, and not chiefly for his piety, he could not, but, vpon this occasion, haue most bitterly hated him. This must teach vs, in louing others to examine our owne heartes, what it is we loue in them; whether the image of God, or the deceiueable shadowes of the world. And those that haue much loue, and many friends, must learne wisedome not to take all for friends, that pretend affection. And because the heart of man is thus deceitfull in loue, as in nothing more, it must teach vs in the multitude of greatest, and strongest friends to fly vnto God, and to make his loue our chiefest staies. His loue I say, which is without deceit, without repentance, without the least shadow of turning. For whom he once loues, he loues to the end. Mans lous is often deceitfull, that we may iustly complaine with <hi>Iob, My friendes</hi>

                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:19272:158"/> anger. The deceit is, when we thinke we hate mens sinnes, when indeede it is their persons, and that wee are angrie for sinne against God, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is for some iniurie done to our selues. For so it is, that gods cause, and our owne often meete together. And wherein we are wronged, therein also is God. Now hence, by reason of this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and concurrence of Gods cause, and our owne, we are very apt, and ready to deceiue our selues; thinking our anger is directed against the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, whereas, in truth, it hath reference only to that which is but an appurtenance, and hang by thereto, namely our owne offence.</p>
               <p>The discouery therefore of this deceit is, <note place="margin">The discoue-thereof.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 In the partition of Gods cause, and our owne. Let vs marke how wee are affected, either when God is dishonoured without our iniurie, or wee iniuried without any great impeachment of Gods honour. Now if wee can be as hotte as tostes in our owne priuate iniuries, where Gods glory is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question, and yet as cold as yce, when most dishonorable indignities are offered to the Lord without any touch of our selues: then it is euident, that in those cases, where Gods cause and our own are ioyned together, our anger was onely for our owne, not for Gods. When our seruants, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue neglected their duty to vs, there is iust cause of anger. For Gods commandement is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them. But deceiue not thy selfe, when vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence thou lettest loose the bridle to thy rage. For how often hast thou thy selfe fayled far more in thy duty to God, how often hast thou seen
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19272:159"/> thy children, and seruants dishonour the name of the Lord many waies, and yet wast neuer halfe so angry? Here was the triall of Moses his anger. When the people murmured, &amp; when <hi>Korah</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against him, here was iust cause of anger. But here Gods cause, and his owne were coupled. Let vs therfore marke <hi>Moses</hi> his behauiour, when they were singled. <hi>Num.</hi> 12. <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> offer him a priuate iniury. It is sayd his meeknesse was such that he gaue them not a word. Againe <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. the people had fallen to idolatry, and had made a calfe, and <hi>Aaron</hi> had his hand therein. Here gods quarrell was seuered from his owne. And how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he himselfe here. He spares neither <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the people, but in a godly fitte of zeale takes on, breakes the two tables in pieces &amp;c. A meeke lambe in his owne iniury: A fierce Lion in Gods. Here was pure anger, free from guile, and gall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If our anger be properly against sinne, then it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will keepe vs from sinning grosly in being angry. For what likelihood is there, that he is truly angry against sinne, that commits a greater sinne in his anger, then the sinne whereat hee is angry? Thus many are angry for small offences, which indeede are sinnes also against God: but in their anger they are so distempered, that they breake out into cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, raging, rayling &amp;c. which are farre greater sinnes, then that wherewith they are discontent. Here was <hi>Dauids</hi> anger against <hi>Nabal</hi> discouered to be faulty. He might happily persuade him selfe he had cause to be offended. For <hi>Nabals</hi> churlish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnesse was odious to God. Yet that was
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19272:159"/> not it which angred <hi>Dauid.</hi> For then how came it to passe that his anger prouoked him to sweare, to conceiue a bloudy purpose of murther? Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets not sinne, but holdes backe from sin. Grace is neuer a paire of bellowes to blow vp in vs the fire of corruption; so as is often our anger. And therfore our anger then is not of grace, but of corruption.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Holy anger, that is conceiued against sinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth not any thing vnfit vs for duties, wee owe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, or man, no not that man, with whom we are angry. As <hi>Moses</hi> was angry with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and chode them sharpely, yet withall prayed for them hartily. As when our children through their owne fault haue gotte some sickenesse, for all our angry speaches, wee goe to the Physition for them. Christ, when he was angrie with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, at the same time mourned for their sinne. <hi>Ionathan</hi> was angry with his father for vowing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 3. 5.</note> death: yet his anger made him speake nothing vnbeseeming the duty, either of a sonne to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of a subiect to his souereigne. Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne is alwayes ioyned with loue of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sincere anger is a <hi>louing</hi> anger, a <hi>deuout</hi> anger. It fittes a man for the duties of loue to men, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion to God. This anger is a whetstone to praier, and by helpe of it, thou shalt pray better then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If then thine anger so disguise thee, and put thee out of frame, that thou canst not tell, either how to pray to God, or looke, or speake louingly to man, not only the person angring thee, but scarse any other, it is a conuiction of the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy anger.</p>

               <p n="1">1 When, vpon the ceasing of the punishment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wee are cheered presently, though still both the guilt, and filth of our sinne sticke in our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Like as the foolish boy is glad, when the smarting plaister is off, though his sore still remaine vnhealed. Whereas, if it were the sin that grieued
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19272:161"/> vs, our griefe, together with our sinne, should out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last the punishment. But if once we haue any ease of our punishment, wee giue ouer our sorrowing forthwith. Which shewes that, with those Iewes, we mourne only for our corne and oile &amp;c. <note place="margin">Hos. 7. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Discouery is by the property of godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is to make a man fresh, and nimble in his spirits for prayer, and other good duties. Whereas worldly sorrow lies heauy like lead vpon a mans heart, and will make a man sleepe sooner, then pray; as in <hi>Ionas</hi> sleeping in the middest of a terrible tempest, which droue euen the prophane mariners to prayer; and in the disciples, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed with wordly sorrow, were neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to watch one houre with Christ in prayer, nor fitte to heare that doctrine, which Christ otherwise was ready to haue taught them. For so our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told them. <hi>I haue many things to say vnto you: but</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 12.</note>
                  <hi>you are not able to beare them;</hi> namely, because their spirits were dulled, and deaded with wordly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Which, euen in this sense also, may be said to cause death; though yet the opposition of life, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> which the Apostle maketh in that place 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. seeme to restraine the sense to spirituall death. But it is true that worldly sorrow causeth euen this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death. Whereas godly sorrowe procures a good conscience, which is the very health of the bones, a continuall feast. Euen in the very acte of mourning is a mans heart light, and cheerefull. If then wee finde our senses quickened, our spirits reuiued by our sorrow, so that we feele it to giue winges to our prayers, which before lay groueling
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19272:161"/> on the ground, then haue wee an argument it is sound, and good. For godly sorrowe is alwaies mixed with, nay indeed proceedes from faith, which, in the apprehension of mercy, yeeldes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ioy, to delay the bitternesse of our teares. But if we haue no heartes to pray, if our sorrow make vs spiritually, both dumbe, that we cannot speake to God, and deafe, that we cannot, with those Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, heare God speaking to vs; then haue wee <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 9.</note> cause to suspect our sorrow, as vnsound, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Deceit of our sorrow, when our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sorrow is couered with the title of sorrow for <note place="margin">Do not many mourne in the aduersity of the Gospell, because they mourne for their owne aduersity? oh great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our heartes! ô bottomlesse pit of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie! Greenh. in Psal. 119. ver. 139. Discouery.</note> the publique euils of the Church, where wee liue. Vsually it falleth out, that euery one of vs in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular are interested in the publike calamities of the state, where we liue, and so are pinched with the sense of their smart. Hence many deceitfully ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, they are grieued for the publike euils, when indeede it is no otherwise for the publike, then as they touch them in particular.</p>
               <p>Here the discouery is.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the separation of our owne cause from the Churches. As when, it going ill with the Church, it goes well with vs in particular. If then wee can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> distast our owne priuate felicities, and call them <hi>Icabods,</hi> as that good woman did her sonne when the arke was captiued, if then we are as pensiue, as <note place="margin">1. Sam. 4. 21.</note> if we our selues in our owne persons susteyned that which the Church doth▪ then it is an argument our griefe is sincere. As in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> whom his owne ease, and great grace, and authority in the Kings
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19272:162"/> Court could nothing cheere, or comfort, in the common calamities of the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When besides the common euils of the Church: we suffer some personall afflictions, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> concerne vs solely. If our griefe bee truely for the Churches euils, then, in this case, the sense of griefe for the publike euils will blunt the edge of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate sorrow. As in two diseases of the body the stone, and the goute, when they meete together, the griefe of the stone, because it is the greater, doth take away all sense of the goute, because it is the lesse: so here in a godly minde the griefe for our owne priuate is drowned in the greater griefe for the Churches publike distresses. But if it be quite contrary with vs, that we cannot feele the churches misery, wee are so affected with the sense of our owne, this is more then a presumption, that when the Churches afflictions were our owne, we mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then for them, only as our owne, and not as the Churches; making the name of the Church only a vizour, and imitating <hi>Polus,</hi> that, vnder the representation of an anothers griefe, truely, and heartily lamented the death of his owne sonne.</p>

               <p n="1">1 When our <hi>vnnaturall</hi> desires are cloaked with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the name of <hi>naturall.</hi> Though mens desires are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and insatiable, yet for all this vsually they deceiue themselues with this, that they desire only a competency, neither pouerty, nor riches, but only Agurs conuenient portion. Now competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is that, which will not onely serue <hi>nature,</hi> but
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19272:162"/> that also which is fitte for our <hi>estate,</hi> and <hi>calling.</hi> And so that which is but competent for one estate and calling, as say a Magistrate, is superfluity for another, as say a priuate man. Well then, let vs see whether it be so vsually with our desires, as they pretend, that they confine themselues within the boundes of mediocrity, and competency. The <note place="margin">Discouery.</note> triall wilbe this, if, when they haue that which is competent, they then rest contented. For there are three desires. The desire of <hi>nature,</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> of <hi>corruption. Nature</hi> will be content with little: <hi>grace</hi> with lesse: but <hi>corruption</hi> is insatiable. If then there be no ho with our desires, but when they haue got that, which themselues, at first, would sette downe as a matter of competency, yet they still are like the crauing horse-leaches, that cry <hi>Giue, giue,</hi> it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note place="margin">Desideria natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralia finita sunt: ex falsa opinione nas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So, when men shall say, I desire only a sufficiency, if I had but so much, I should be well apaid then, and yet, when they haue that, couet more greedily then euer before, this is an ague, a dropsie, a disease: noe naturall, noe kindly thirst. But here this deceite of our desires is so much the harder to be discouered, in that it is not so easie to define in euery thing that which is competent. And so vnder the couer of competency we quickly fall into the snare of pleasure, and excesse. This S. <hi>Austen</hi> excellently describes in the desire of meates and drinkes, and by like proportion we may apply

For though there be fitte matter in this office to kindle a holy, and spirituall desire, namely the beauty of the office it selfe, Gods glory, and mans saluation shining in the very face thereof: yet withall there is some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to stirre vp a crooked, and couetous desire, namely the hope of gaine in a fat benefice. Here a couetous <hi>Balaam</hi> will hide his base desire of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the office, with pretence of a spirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the office it selfe. Such is the deceit of those that buy liuings vnder this pretence, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to exercise their giftes which otherwise, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the times being such, they cannot haue the vse of. So also in the matter of marriage this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is very vsuall. The party affected hath piety matchable both to person, &amp; portion, &amp; yet both these in good measure too. Here one, too much wedded to the world, or to the flesh, will cloake his affection to portion, or person, with a pretence of affection to piety; as though that had the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in swaying of his desires. Where happely, if the heart be truly searched, the contrary will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>The discouery of this deceit is when the matter <note place="margin">Discouery.</note> that should satisfie the carnall desire being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there only remaineth the inuiter, and inciter
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19272:164"/> of the spirituall, and holy. For if then we desire not as feruently as before, we may iustly feare fraude in our desires. Here <hi>cooled</hi> desires are <hi>crafty, decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deceiuing, flinching, false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Affection is <hi>confidence.</hi> Where the deceit is, to <note place="margin">6 Confidence. The deceit:</note> thinke we trust in God, when indeede we trust only in the meanes. The deceit is, both when we haue the meanes, and when wee want them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <note place="margin">and discouery.</note> of both, is discouered by our behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in the presence of the meanes. For if then wee giue ouer praying to God, or abate of our feruency in suing, and seeking to him for his helpe, wee may well doubt of our confidence. For if wee doe truely relye on God, as on him who is sufficient without meanes, and without whom euen the most sufficient meanes are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, why then doe wee beginne so to secure our selues, and lay aside all feare, when once wee are fensed with the meanes? Againe hauing beene so confident and comfortable in the enioyment of the meanes, if afterward in the time of danger, when the meanes faile vs, we loose this confidence and shewe our selues faint, and heartlesse cowards, this also is another conuiction of deceite in our confidence. So both these wayes is our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence found out to be deceitfull, both by excesse of spirite in peace, and by want of spirite in trouble.</p>
               <p>The like deceits might be shewed in diuers other affections. But the worke growing bigger then I thought it would, I forbeare. So much then shall suffice to haue spoken concerning the deceitfulnesse
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19272:164"/> of the affections; as also concerning the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the deceitfulnesse of heart.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the greatnesse of the hearts deceitfulnesse, and of the cause of her deceitfulnesse.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAuing thus spoken of the deceitfulnes of mans heart, it remaineth that now we should speak <note place="margin">Illustrations of the hearts deceitfulnesse. 1. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it.</note> of those three illustrations, which in the beginning we noted the Prophet vsed to set it forth by.</p>
               <p>The first is, from the greatnesse of this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It is deceitfull, saies the Prophet, <hi>aboue all things.</hi> Aboue all things? what aboue Sathan that old serpent? The meaning is not that our harts haue more craft then Sathan, who is an olde trained soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, and his crafts-master in this art, we being but punies, and as of yesterday vnto him, who is of many thousand yeres standing: but that that deceit which is in our hearts, in regard of vs, and the dangerous consequences thereof to vs, is greater, then that in Sathan.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to murther ones selfe is a greater matter, then to murther another, though he doe not vse the like cruelty in stabbing, and wounding of himselfe, which is oftēs vsed in the killing of others: So also to deceiue ones selfe (which is also a spirituall kinde of murther) is a greater deceite then to deceiue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19272:165"/> And so in this sense the deceitfulnesse of our hearts may be said to be aboue Sathans, because it deceiueth <hi>it selfe,</hi> though Sathan in his deceits bee farre more cunning, and wilie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This amplifieth the deceit, when the person deceiuing is our familiar friend, one in whome wee repose speciall confidence. See <hi>Psalm.</hi> 55. 12. 13. So is it heete. Sathan is nothing so neere vs, as our owne hearts, that are parts of our selues. Sathan is without vs, and if we resist him by faith, hee flieth from vs, but our hearts are within vs, and though we resist neuer so much, yet this deceiuer still stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth close vnto vs. So that Sathan sometimes leaues vs for a season, and wee are not troubled with him, <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 13.</note> or his deceits. But our owne hearts, they neuer leaue vs, they dogge, and follow vs at all times, in all places, vpon all occasions, still ready furnished with deceit to beguile vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our owne harts can deceiue vs of themselues, without Sathan: Sathan cannot, without our harts. And therfore, in regard of vs, our owne harts deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes is farre the greater, as that, which giueth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than all his aduantage against vs. He could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our Sauiour, because there was no decceit in our Sauiours heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> This must teach vs to account of our selues as of our cheefest enemies we are to contend with, in this spirituall conflict. The Apostle stirres vp to watchfulnesse, and circumspection, by setting <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 12.</note> before vs the strength of the Diuells, as being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and principalities, farre stronger then flesh and bloud. But there by <hi>flesh and bloud</hi> the Apostle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:19272:165"/> not so much the <hi>corruption</hi> as the <hi>weakenesse</hi> of our nature. As if he should haue said, wee haue not onely to conflict with weake, fraile men like our selues, that are but flesh and bloud, but with farre more powerfull and puissant aduersaries, namely the Diuels. For the corruption of our hearts is our greatest aduersarie, this corrupt heart of ours is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull aboue all things, euen Sathan himselfe in some sort, as we haue shewed. And therefore wee must bend our forces against our selues as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sathan: yea the way indeede to ouercome Sathan, is first to ouercome our selues: and we must <note place="margin">Ita caue tibi vt caueas teipsum.</note> so take heede to our selues, of other enemies, that we must also take heede of our selues, as enemies. A thing worth the noting it is, that the incestuous person deliuered vp to Sathan, did yet repent, and <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 5. 2. Cor. 2. 6 7.</note> come out of Sathans power. But men once deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to themselues, the lusts and deceits of their owne hearts, are branded out in the Scripture, as men in a most fearefull and desperate case. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. Psal. 81. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in his owne person describing the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fight, and the aduersary a Christian is specially to incounter with, singles out the body of sinne, this naughty flesh. <hi>I fight not,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>as beating the aire,</hi> and seeing no aduersary, but I see my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 29.</note> and strike at him. And who may this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie be? Hee tells vs in the next words; <hi>I beate downe my body,</hi> that is, not this outward man, but the body of sinne, the masse of corruption, both in the soule, and in the body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second illustration</hi> is from the cause of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse, <note place="margin">2. The cause of it.</note> namely the wickednesse of our hearts.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:19272:166"/> The heart, saith the Prophet is deceitfull aboue all things, and <hi>euill</hi> in; this latter clause, shewing the cause of that spoken in the former.</p>
               <p>Heere two things are to be cleered. 1. What this illnesse of the hart is. 2. How it is a cause of the harts deceitfulnesse.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>totally</hi> euill, and that two waies. First, the <hi>whole soule</hi> is in euill: And secondly <hi>whole euill</hi> is in the soule.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The whole soule is in euill, this gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath imbittered, this leuen hath sowred, this leprosie hath infected, not this part, or that, but the whole, and euery part. Euen from the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as it were the crowne of the head, to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it were the soales of the feete, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but boyles and botches. Whereof read a most liuely description, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. In our vnderstanding there is a very sea of ignorance, vncapable it is of things spirituall, and yet wise and witty in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The conscience is full of blind feares, terrors, and torments, or else seared and senselesse. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory slippery, and waterish to receiue and retaine any good impressions, but of a marble firmenesse, to hold fast that which is euill. The will pliable and obsequious to the Diuell, in his hands as waxe: but stiffe and hard as clay in Gods. The affections also are wholly disordered, peruersly setting themselues vpon wrong obiects: in stead of bathing the sweete fountaines of liuing waters, they swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishly lye tumbling in filthy, and miry puddles. If in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:19272:166"/> the eye there bee a beame of wickednesse, ô then the great stack that is in the hart! And if the tongue <note place="margin">Si trabes in ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, strues in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> but the instrument of the heart, be such a worlde of wickednesse, an vnrulie euill; what then is the hart? The whole frame of our hearts is continually euill. O the rout and rabble of filthy, and impure thoughts that lurke in this dungeon. The temple it was once of the holy Ghost: but now, as it fareth with many materiall temples, which, as it is reported through couetousnesse of inclosiers, are become stables for horses, so this glorious temple is become a stinking stie, and stable of vncleane spirits, a cage of vnclean birds, a den of theeues, a receptacle of all manner of pollution.</p>
               <p n="2">II. All euill, the whole body of sinne, that is, he seedes, and spawnes euen of the vilest corruptions are in the heart of man. Naturally the best of vs haue an inclinablenes euen to the most odious, and loathsome sinnes. As in that <hi>chaos</hi> at first creation there were the seedes of all the creatures, fire, aire, water, heauen, earth, so in mans heart of all sins. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, let but the spirit of Sathan moue, as once the spirit of God vpon the <hi>chaos,</hi> &amp; with the warmth of his temptacions heat it, and no lesse ougly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will proceede out of our hearts, then did once goodly creatures out of that <hi>chaos.</hi> Hence it was, that those things which <hi>Dauid</hi> spake of certaine vile notorious wicked sinners, that their <hi>throat was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen sepulchre, the gall of aspes was vnder their tongue, &amp;c.</hi> are applied by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to euery mothers child of vs. For there is neuer a barrell better herring. But as the holy prouerbe is, <hi>As in water, fare answereth to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 27. 19.</note>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:19272:167"/>
                  <hi>face, so doth the hart of man to man.</hi> The image of our face in the water is no more like our face it self, then our heart is like the heart euen of the vilest monster, that euer was. And when wee see such monsters in them, as in looking glasses, wee may see our selues, and the disposition of our owne soules. And thus we see how the heart is <hi>totally</hi> euill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is also originally euill. Euill did not begin first to pollute thy hand, thy eye, thy eare, or any of thy outward parts, but it began with thy hart to seat and nestle it selfe there, and from thence to diffuse, and scatter it poyson into the externall members. <hi>Out of the heart,</hi> saith our Sauiour, <hi>come murthers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, thefts, blasphemies,</hi> and such like stuffe; euen <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 19.</note> as the riuers out of the sea. This is the fountaine, from whence all the streames of corruption flowe, this is the wombe, in which all these monsters are conceiued, this is the shell, in which these cockatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are hatched. Thus we see how we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this doctrine of the hearts wickednesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> 1. Against the Papists, that do somthing lessen this wickednesse, and will haue some reliques of goodnesse to remaine, some freedome of will to apply it selfe to good. II. To teach vs all true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, in the sight of our owne naturall defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. No outward ornaments should so lift vs vp, as our inward filthines should take vs downe. Art thou troubled with pride? J can prescribe thee no better remedy then to looke vpon the face of thy heart in the glasse of the word. For there thou shalt see thy selfe such an ougly, nasty, forlorne, mishapen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that thou canst not chuse but grow out of loue
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:19272:167"/> with thy selfe. It is thy ignorance that maketh thee so proud. If thou knewest thy selfe what thou wert, and haddest eies to see this sinke▪hole, and what a deale of baggage passeth daily through it, thou wouldest be ashamed of thy selfe. God is a God of pure eies, and cannot take any pleasure in euill: And wilt thou then take any pleasure in thy selfe being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and nought but euill, yea beeing but a very stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dunghill of euill? Whatsoeuer thy outside may be, be it neuer so faire, thy inside is nought; thou art but like one of the Aegyptian temples, very glorious and beautifull without, but enter in, and nothing to bee seene, but a serpent, or some such venemous creature. Such litters and swarmes are there in our hearts of vaine, vile, base, filthy, and dishonourable thoughts, affections, desires. Very <hi>thorough-faires</hi> are they for Sathans impure suggestions to walke vp &amp; downe in; in regard of murtherous and malitious thoughts, very <hi>slaughter houses;</hi> in regard of vncleane lusts very <hi>stewes</hi> and <hi>brothel-houses;</hi> in regard of the heat of boyling concupiscence, very <hi>hotte houses,</hi> and as the Prophet speaketh, like a <hi>bakers ouen.</hi> Shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Hosea 7. 4.</note> now bragge of his owne good nature, or crake with the Pharisee, that hee is not so badde as other men, he is no extortioner, or oppressor, &amp;c. Yes, thou blind and boasting Pharisee, thou hast the seedes of extortion, and oppression in thee, yea, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinnes besides. And these would breake forth in thee, did not God by his wise and powerfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence restraine thy corruption. By nature, the best, the mildest, and meekest man is a very tiger and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And wouldest thou account that Lion to be of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19272:168"/> a better nature, then his fellowes, who therefore does no hurt as they doe, because hee is not loose as they are, but chained vp? Where Gods renewing grace hath not changed our nature, it is onely the powerfull restraint of his prouidence, which keepeth men from the very outrage of villany. Shall we then be proud, because wee are free from those offences, into which others breake forth, and thinke wee are made of some better mould? nay our nature is as vntoward, and as deeply poysoned with rebellion as theirs. Therefore rather should we be humbled in seeing them. For, as was shewed, in them wee may see our selues what we are. Peraduenture thou hast some good parts of wit, memory, &amp;c. to commend thee. Yet for all these, thy heart is euill, yea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a spirituall change, so much the worse, by how much these parts are the better. Euen as the more fruitfull the soyle is, so much the more will it abound with thistles, vnlesse it be tilled. And <hi>the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 20 expounded.</note>
                  <hi>the thoughts of the wise,</hi> [that is, such as excell in in natural gifts, that are the choysest and most pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; euen the very flowre of the rest] <hi>that they are vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Heere parents, and al they who stand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the education of youth, must remember their dutie. The heart of man in generall, the heart of all mankinde, is strangely, and strongly wicked. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the heart of a young childe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saies, <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 15.</note> there is a <hi>bundell,</hi> and packe of folly laid vp. And as <hi>Moses</hi> saies, the thoughts of mans heart are euill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Gen 9. 21</note> from his childhood. This corruption then of nature must be subdued betimes, else it will grow to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19272:168"/> that head, that it will be incurable. Looke what skill, &amp; dexterity is required to tame a wild beast, which had need bee gone about very earely, whiles it is but a little whelpe, the same, nay far greater is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tame and meeken this wild, this woluish, and lionish nature of ours, that it may become tractable to Gods hand.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This serues to take away the excuse which is so rife in the mouthes of many, that when they swear speake vainely or do otherwise amisse, yet they haue as good hearts as the best. What is the reason then they haue so bad tongues? <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi> When I see the smoake comming out at the top of the chimney, sure I am there is some fire on the hearth. When the flouds of corruptiō come gushing out at thy eies, ears, hands, mouth, there must needes be a fountaine within in thy heart. For it is the heart that is originally euill. And therefore excellently <hi>Salomon,</hi> hauing descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the wickednesse of some mens eies, mouthes, feete, hands, at last, giuing the reason thereof, saies, <hi>Lewd things are in his heart.</hi> And in another place, hauing said, <hi>the thoughts of the wicked are abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 6. 12. 13. 14 Pro. 15. 26.</note>
                  <hi>to the Lord;</hi> he addeth by way of opposition <hi>but the wordes of the pure are pleasant.</hi> The opposition seemed rather to require that he should haue saide, <hi>But the thoughts.</hi> But by this kind of opposition <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> would teach, that the wordes of our mouthes are according to the thoughts of our hearts. And therefore it is idle to talke of a clean hart, when thou hast a foule mouth.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This teacheth vs a right method in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:19272:169"/> of repentance. That must first bee reformed, which was first deformed. Now as we haue shewed the heart is originally euill, that is, the treasury and store-house of wickednesse. Therefore the first thing in repentance, must be the rinsing and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the heart. If sinne had begunne in thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, then should thy reformation also. But <hi>Eues</hi> heart was poysoned before her eye. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not so well like their aduise, that wish men in repentance to beginne with outward abstinence from sinne, as the easier, and so by degrees to come to the inward mortification of it. Hee were an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Physition, that when the headach is caused by the distemperature of the stomack, would apply outward remedies to the head, before hee had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the stomacke, where lies the matter that feedes the disease. The heart as our Sauiour teacheth, is an euill treasurie, surcharged with the superfluities of al wickednesse, and hence flowes corruption, and hath a continuall eruption in the outward man. So that it is impossible, the outward man, or actions thereof should bee reformed, as long as the heart remaines vnpurged. Things in themselues good, comming yet from an vncleane heart, are naught. Therefore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> excellently saies, that not onely the <hi>pride</hi> of <note place="margin">Pro. 21. 4. opened.</note> wicked mens eies, and hearts, but euen their very <hi>plowing,</hi> that is, whatsoeuer they do in things lawful as eating, drinking, sleeping, yea in the seruice of God, is <hi>sinne.</hi> Listen we then rather to the Prophets counsell, <hi>O Ierusalem wash thine heart,</hi> and to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Cleanse your harts you sinners.</hi> Let none think <note place="margin">Ier. 4. 14. Iames. 4.</note> they are reformed enough when they haue brought
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19272:169"/> their outward man to some ciuill conformitie, their hearts yet inwardly swelling againe, til they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burst with aboundance of euill, and noysome lusts. No, the heart, as it is the fountaine of this <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> life, and as at first it was the fountaine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> life: so also must it be the fountaine of a <hi>spirituall</hi> life; that as in the motion of the <hi>primum mobile</hi> in the heauens, all the inferiour spheres are mooued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it: so heere the heart being spiritually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy Ghost, in the worke of conuersion, al our outward parts may moue together with it; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them receiuing from it, as frō a good tresu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their seuerall portions of goodnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So much for the first point, what this wickednesse is. The second is, that this wickednesse of the heart is the cause of this deceitfulnesse: which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Prophets coniunction of wickednesse with deceitfulnesse, in this place. For this propertie of deceitfulnesse is by the Apostle giuen to sinne: and so our hearts come to be deceitfull, as they are <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> defiled with sinne. For sinne blinds the minde, and and so makes it easie to be deceiued, and to mistake. We see how easily blinde <hi>Isaack</hi> mistooke the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sonne, for the elder. As easily are our blind harts deceiued, mistaking the motions of the flesh for the spirit, suggestions of Sathan for the voice of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, pretences and colours of zeale, for true, &amp; naturall zeale, &amp;c. Thereafter therefore as sinne is more or lesse in the heart, so is deceit. The most godly men, by reason they are not wholly free from sinne, haue also experience of this deceitfulnesse. But the deceitfulnesse of wicked mens hearts is farre
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:19272:170"/> greater, by reason that sinne in them is farre greater euen in his full strength, and vigor: but in the godly sinne is as it were wounded in the head, and crazed in the braine, and so lesse able to deceiue. The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls sinne in the godly the <hi>old man.</hi> Now olde men that are ready to dote for age are twice chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and haue no great store of craft.</p>
               <p>This must teach vs, as we desire in the profession <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>1</label> of religion, not to be deceiued by our owne hearts, so to purge, to rinse, and renew them daily by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not suffering the least sinne to bee harboured there. For if we haue an euill heart, affecting and nourishing but any one sinne, this heart will deceiue vs in the end, whatsoeuer be our profession of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Iudas</hi> may be an example to vs. His hart was an euill hart, a couetous hart, euen in the greatest heat of his following Christ, and preaching the worde. Therefore also it proued a deceitfull hart, and at last betrayed him into the hands of that fearefull sin of betraying his Master. Neither is there any other reason why those forward, and feruent ones in the parable of the stony ground fall away, but the want of a <hi>good and honest heart,</hi> which onely they that are figured by the last kind of ground, haue. For as an honest man will not deceiue another, with whom, so neither wil an honest hart deceiue the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in whom it is. This was the reason that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and other their fits of godlinesse did not last, because there was no true change of their naughty, and corrupt hearts. Remember wee then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles warning, <hi>Take heede least there bee in you an euill</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb, 3, 12.</note>
                  <hi>heart to depart away from the liuing God.</hi> Where there
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:19272:170"/> is an vnsound heart, there will be Apostacie in the end, whatsoeuer showes be made. For an euil hart is alwaies a deceitfull heart.</p>
               <p>Again this must further teach vs not to trust them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in whom wee doe discerne an euil and vnsound hart, let their outward shows be neuer so glorious. For an euill heart will deceiue the man himselfe in whome it is, much more will it deceiue others. How now can any man safely repose any confidence in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate friend, or seruant, whose hearts are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and vnrenewed, though otherwise neuer so ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly honest? What assurance can I haue of him, that hath none of himselfe? Or how should I thinke hee will not deceiue me, who in the end must needes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himselfe?</p>

                  <hi>life?</hi> As it fareth with the eye, which seeing other things, sees not it selfe, nor the face wherein it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, so is it with our hearts, knowing other things, yet ignorant of themselues, strangers at home. We know not what wee are in present, much lesse what we shall be heereafter, in triall and temptation. So that that which <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh of Kings harts, <hi>The heauens in height, and the earth in deepenesse, and the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 25. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Kings heart can no man finde out,</hi> in regard of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret proiects, and designes, is true also of al our harts, in regard of their secret wickednesse Men thinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that they know themselues well enough. And it is growne into a prouerbiall kind of speech, I know it as well as my selfe. Whereas in trueth there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein we are more ignorant. An euident argument whereof is that pride, and selfe-pleasing, that naturall; is in vs all. If thou haddest once seene what on vglie and deformed face thy heart hath, if thou knewest, what horrible filthinesse, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were inclosed in thy heart, this would humble, and abase thee, both before God &amp; man, this would bring thee quite out of heart, and conceite with thy selfe, and make thee according to the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <note place="margin">Philip, 2.</note> thinke thy selfe worse then any other. But alas, how swell wee in a conceit of our own excellency?
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:19272:171"/> how stretch we out our plumes? how despise wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in regard of our selues? when yet, if wee thoroughly saw the close corruptions of our owne hearts, wee should thinke the worst better then our selues. Yea in our very praiers, speaking to God, how farre are we from the true humbling, bowing, and prostrating our spirits before the Lord. Whereas if we saw and felt our pouerty and misery, wee should speake to God, as the poore beggerly wretch doth to the rich man. <hi>The poore man,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, speaketh supplications.</hi> When a man comes abroad with his <note place="margin">Pro, 18. 23.</note> face full of spots, it is a signe that he knowes not of them, that he did not vse the looking glasse, before he came out. A farre more certaine signe it is, that as yet we haue not in the law seene the faces of our hearts, when we can so boldly, &amp; impudently come both into Gods, and mans presence, with grosse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions vnwashen out. When <hi>Iob</hi> saw, in Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as in a glasse, his owne corruption, how was hee presently meekened? then hee laies the hand on the mouth, abhorres himselfe in dust, and ashes, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies himselfe to the full. <hi>Peter</hi> also vpon like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Iob. 41. 5. 6.</note> cries out, <hi>Depart Lord from me, I am a sinfull man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 5. 8.</note> According to our humilty is our knowledge of our selues. The more we see our corruption, the greater will be our humility. When <hi>Paul</hi> saw the filthy pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of concupiscense that was in him, then was hee throughly taken downe indeede. Before, he seemed to be aliue to himselfe, but this so gastly a sight of the filthy visage of his own hart as at his first conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it almost stroke him dead, so long after it made him cry out, <hi>I am carnall, Miserable man that I am.</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:19272:172"/> Our great pride therfore argues great ignorāce, our little humility but little knowledge of our own harts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> 1. Let vs not beare out our selues too much vpon any mans iudgement. For if wee know not our selues, and so may bee deceiued in our selues, much lesse then can others know vs, and so farre more easily may they bee deceiued in vs. <hi>I iudge not my selfe,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>for though I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4 4.</note> He that iudgeth me is the Lord, who is greater then our harts. Euen the best haue many secret faults, which they spie not, and therfore haue need to pray, <hi>Lord clense vs from our secret sins.</hi> Though our owne hearts condemne vs not, yet may wee not please our selues therein, but still dread we the secret deceit of our harts, so vast gulfes, that the bottome can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be sounded. As <hi>Socrates</hi> in reading a booke gaue this censure, those things which I vnderstood, were good, so also, I thinke, were those things I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not: so in iudging of our hearts contrarily, that which I haue found out, and do discerne in my heart is exceeding ill, so I thinke is that also, which as yet I doe not discerne. By that little, wee haue alreadie found out, should we iudge of the rest.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Heere is comfort for Gods children, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne corruptions are exceedingly cast downe, and affrighted with so fearefull a sight. But we must learne to distinguish betweene corruption <hi>seene,</hi> and the <hi>seeing</hi> of corruption. The corruption which we see offereth matter of discomfort: but the seeing of corruption yeeldeth great comfort. For heere the Prophet telleth vs, that no man can know
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:19272:172"/> it, namely of himselfe, and by the light of his owne reason onely. An argument therefore, that God hath annointed thy eies with spirituall eye-salue, when he hath thus inabled thee to see thy owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Comfort thy selfe then in this work of Gods mercy, and assure thy selfe that that God, who hath giuen thee to see, wil giue thee also in time, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due thy seen and disliked corruptions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This must teach vs to trauell with our owne hearts, in bringing them to a sight of their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. If we be admonished of some man, with whom we conuerse, that he is false and hollow, how will wee labour to finde him out, and detect him? The Scripture hath giuen vs warning of our owne hearts, that they are deepe and deceitfull beyond al measure. Doth it not then stand vs in hand to labor to finde out this deceit, and wickednesse? What a shame is this, that man, who flies vp into the heuens, and descends downe into the deeps, and knowes all other things, should yet onely not know himselfe? that he should dig in the belly of the earth for gold and siluer, and should not digge in his owne heart to purge out the drosse, which hath corrupted all that gold, which grew there at the first?</p>
               <p>Heere none may discourage himselfe with these words, <hi>who can know it?</hi> for they argue not an vtter impossibility, but an exceeding difficulty. Which should sharpen our desires, and indeuours, for the getting of this knowledge.</p>
               <p>For first, there are certaine discoueries, whereby euen others may come to the knowledge of our hearts, in some measure. And secondly, in the word
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:19272:173"/> of God there are infallible notes, whereby exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our harts, we our selues may know them, when others cannot so well.</p>
               <p>For the first. There are sixe more especiall means <note place="margin">Means of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery. 1. Discouery by the worde.</note> of triall, and discouery of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is the <hi>reuelation of Gods word,</hi> whether the law or Gospell. For whereas corruption lay asleepe in vs before, the sound of the word awakens, and inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it. <hi>When I would haue healed Israel,</hi> namely by the admonitions, and rebukes of the word, <hi>then the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 7. 1.</note>
                  <hi>iniquity of Ephraim was discouered,</hi> saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Before the Law came, <hi>Paul</hi> felt sinne more quiet, as if it had beene dead: but saies he, <hi>when the law came, then sinne reuiued.</hi> The like our Sauiour <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> shews of the Gospell, that when it comes, it sets men <note place="margin">Luc. 12. 51.</note> together by the eares, only because it worketh vpon their corruption, which being by this meanes exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, shewes it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is <hi>affliction,</hi> both priuate and personall, as also publique in the persecution of the Church. The sea, <note place="margin">2. Discouery, by affliction.</note> when it is calme wether, is as still and quiet as any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but let the windes once rise, and you shall see a difference. Then you shall see nothing but raging, and storming &amp; foaming out mire and dirt. In peace wicked mens corruptions lye hid, then they wil car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie themselues to God and man, more moderately: but let God lay affliction on them, and then, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than falsly charged <hi>Iob,</hi> see if they will not spit the very poison of their blasphemy in the face of God himselfe. Yea the regenerate man himselfe would hardly thinke there were so much infidelity▪ impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, frowardnesse, rebellion, faint-heartednes, loue
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:19272:173"/> of the worlde, and such like corruptions, as hee shall finde and feele by experience in the day of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore doth <hi>Iames</hi> call afflictions temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because they serue to trye vs, what is in vs, and <note place="margin">Iames. 1. 3.</note> to discouer the hidden corruption of our hearts. As <hi>Moses</hi> telleth the Israelites, God therefore humbled <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2.</note> them with want, to proue them, and to <hi>know</hi> what was in them, that is, to make knowen. Heere was the triall of <hi>Abrahams</hi> sound heart, when God laide that crosse vpon him, that greeuous commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of killing his onely sonne with his owne hands. <hi>Now I know,</hi> saith God, <hi>thou fearest me,</hi> that is, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi>

                  </note> expounds it, Now I haue made it known. For God is said to know, when he makes vs to know, and in such speeches, hee tels vs of his owne working of knowledge in vs, not of his owne knowledge. So we say a <hi>ioyfull day,</hi> and <hi>sad weather,</hi> only because of the effects in vs. For did not God know before that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> feared him? yes well enough. But <hi>Abraham</hi> did not know it before so clearely, and certainly. For by meanes of this triall hee came to know himselfe. For vsually man thinketh he can doe that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede he cannot, and contrarily. It is then as if God should haue said, Now I haue made the world, and thine owne conscience know thou fearest me: Now I haue giuen thee a thorough triall of the integrity of thine owne heart. Heere also was the trial of <hi>Iobs</hi> good heart. Though in his prosperity he had triall of it by his many good workes, wherein he was as rich as in his other riches, yet wee see how slanderously the Diuell impeached it as mercenary, <hi>Doth Iob serue God for nought.</hi> Therefore that he might haue
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:19272:174"/> a more thorough proofe of his integritie, all his outward prosperity was taken from him. And then how meeke, how patient was he? no murmuring, no grudging, but, <hi>the Lord hath giuen, and taken, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hom.</hi> 1. <hi>ad pop. Ant.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>be his name.</hi> He did not then say (as Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome excellently notes) How shall the poore do, that were wont to be clothed with the fliece, and to be fed with the flesh of my cattle? If not for my sake, yet for such poore ones my flocks might haue beene spared. And so <hi>Iobes</hi> graces shined more gloriously, when his houses were ouerthrowne, then when the doores of them were set open for the poore to enter in; when his flockes were stollen from him, then when the poore were susteyned by them. For then he shewed loue to men: but now he shewed a more speciall kinde of loue, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. For as in the Olympicke games the people might farre better iudge of the feature, and elegancie of the sensers bodies, when they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then when their cloathes were on: so may we then best iudge of our selues, when God hath stript vs starke naked of all the garments of our outward glory, and prosperity.</p>
               <p>But a farre more excellent triall are the common afflictions of the Church in persecution. For as the Apostle speaketh of heresies, so is it true also of persecutions, that they <hi>must needes be, that the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued may be made knowne.</hi> To this purpose excellent <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 19.</note> is the speach of old <hi>Simeon</hi> to the Virgin, <hi>That childe is appointed for a signe to bee spoken against that the thoughtes of many heartes may be opened.</hi> Therefore <note place="margin">Luck. 2. 34.</note> Christ must be contradicted, and opposed by the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19272:174"/> high priestes and gouernours of the people, that so the hidden hypocrisie of those which before fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and cried <hi>Osanna,</hi> might be detected, as also those their peruerse, and vnsound thoughts of cleauing to Christ, if he had prooued a temporall King, and had brought temporall felicity. Loe then a knife to open the heartes belly, the knife of persecution. Here was the triall of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> with whom it fared in their af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection to Christ, as with <hi>Ioseph</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iacob</hi> in his affection to his brethren. When he saw them in anguish, and distresse, then hee could conceale his affection no longer, but cryed out, <hi>I am Ioseph your brother. For a brother</hi> saith Salomon, <hi>is borne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 17. 17.</note>
                  <hi>for aduersity</hi> Namely, then to discouer his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he haue any. So when these two saw the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, and cruell dealings of the priestes with Christ their elder Brother, then, though before they were but close disciples and one could hardly tell what to make of them, yet then they manifested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then their loue, their zeale, and hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Christ brake forth. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the true Mother from the false, by taking a sword, to cutte the childe in two; so doe persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours discouer true children of the Church from false, when by the sword of persecution they strike at their Mother. O there bee many of vs in these daies of peace, that make great showes. When the fanne comes, it shall appeare whether we be chaffe, or wheate. The house built on the sand caries as good a show, as the house built on the rocke, and in a cleare sunshine day glisters as gallantly: but the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19272:175"/> windes, and tempests when they are vp, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shew the difference. When a seruing man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes two men walking together, we cannot tell who is his maister, till they part: so when the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and outward prosperity go together, it is hard to iudge, whether of them we follow, til God make a seperation of them by persecution. A wolfe may feyne himselfe to be a sleepe, by wearing a sheepes skinne: but let his fliece bee shorne, it will neuer grow againe, and thereby he will easily bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be no true sheepe. For the true sheepes wooll will growe againe after shearing. And so will Christes sheepe, after they haue beene shorne by persecution. So a parret can counterfeite mans voyce; but let it be beaten, and then it will fall to it owne naturall voyce.</p>
               <p>Now as by affliction we may iudge of our harts for the time <hi>present,</hi> what they <hi>are,</hi> so also for the time <hi>to come,</hi> what they <hi>wil be.</hi> For <hi>impatiency</hi> in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent aduersity,</hi> argues there wil be <hi>insolency</hi> in <hi>future prosperity;</hi> and so discouers that <hi>deceit,</hi> whereof we <note place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> spake, namely, that, if we were in a more plentifull and richer estate, we should be better, then now we are.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Triall</hi> is by <hi>prosperity,</hi> nothing inferiour to the <note place="margin">3. Discouery, by prosperity.</note> former by <hi>aduersity.</hi> For as some like snailes push out their hornes, till they be touched: so others with <hi>Ionathan</hi> followe chase well, till they come where hony is. Nay many there are whom affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath not detected, that peace and prosperity hath. The parable, of the sunne and the winde, is knowne. Some of those in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> daies,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19272:175"/> who kept their garments of faith, and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science fast on, for all the shaking of the boisterous windes, which then raged most fiercely, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the flattering raies of that sweet sunshine, which followed, were tised to vnbutten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and throw off their coats, at least to weare them more loosely; How chast was <hi>Dauid</hi> in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions? If an hundred Batshebaes had then met him, in the wildernesse, he would not much haue beene mooued. But we know, afterward, when he was at rest in his kingdome how fearefully hee was foyled. So that, that which once those women sang of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> by way of ioy and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, may we as truly sing of these two trials, by way of mourning, and lamentation. Aduersity hath slayen his thousands, prosperity ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands. These two of all others are the sorest trials and haue greatest force of detecting; specially when they come both together, as in the three children; who at once, were tryed, both by the sweetnesse of the musicke, to inchant their senses, <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 5. 6.</note> and by the terrour of the fire, to affright, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their hearts. And so haue many holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres been tried both waies, both by the threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and by the faire, and large promises of their aduersaries. Contrary to that God gaue in charge to <hi>Laban,</hi> to speake neither <hi>euill</hi> nor <hi>good</hi> to <hi>Iakob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 24.</note> that is neither by flattery, nor force to go about to bring him backe againe. And this argueth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soundnesse indeede, when in both these trials together we can acquit our selues. As in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist neither ouercome with Herods prison, nor with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:19272:176"/> the peoples conceiting of him to bee the Messiah. In <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> also, standing out both against the proposterous affection of the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> when they would haue deified them, and against their diuelish rage when they would haue stoned them. In <hi>Daniel</hi> likewise, whom neither the <hi>Lions</hi> den, nor the kings fauors &amp; honors could any whit corrupt. Good gold, put it into the fire, and there it wil be purged, and refined: into the water, and there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it will shine brighter. So a good man when he is in the furnace of affliction, there he will leaue much of his drosse behind him: and when he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth in outward blessings, they together with his inward graces shalbe as a jewell hunge vpon a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den earing, he will verifie <hi>Salomons</hi> prouerbe, <hi>The crowne of wise men is their riches.</hi> But the vnsounde Christian is like to clay. It will quickly be scorched, and dried vp in the fire; and it will soone melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and bee dissolued in water. As affliction would discouer his infidelity, distrust in God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, rebellion &amp;c. so a prosperous and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing estate will bewray his pride, insolency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of, and cruelty against his poore brethren, besides his wantonnesse, voluptuousnes, vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; all which lay smothered in affliction, like as poyson doth in the snake, while he is benummed with cold. Let a man handle a snake then, and hee shall not feele his stinge; so one would thinke it were a harmeles creature. But bring him to the fire, <note place="margin">

After then <hi>Peter</hi> had once heard those words come from him, hee smelt him our presently, Away, thy heart is not vpright, <hi>Thou art still in the gall of bitternesse.</hi> Thus many in some companies are holy, &amp; Fonuersing with their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cary themselues well; but in other companies, or conuersing with their equals, or inferiours, are nothing the same men.

This then is a sure proofe of a sounde heart, when we walke with so euen a foote, that, howsoeuer it cannot be, but we must haue experience of humane frailty, yet we neuer break out into such wicked &amp; wilfull courses of falshood, vniustice or such like, which doe giuethely to all our former profession and practise, because they cannot stande in any sort with the truth of religion.

When the Iudges-seemed more difficult, then they vsed great liberty, and boldnes of speach, and spake roundly to them: but when once they became flexible, and yeelded to their request, then they fell downe, and kissed their knees, and handes, abundantly shewing both true courage, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and true meekenesse, and mildnesse. Here both their actions were as a commentary, each to other. Did any man doubt of their liberty of speach, whether it were not malapert saucinesse, and presumption? Their humility in kissing the Iudges knees was enough to free it from that suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Againe might their humbling of themselues at the magistrates feete seeme to sauour of too base, and seruile a spirit? Their former, truly ministeriall, boldnesse sufficiently also acquitted them of this imputation. Thus when there is so sweete a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and goodly a harmony betwixt our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they are so farre from confuting, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding one another, that they answere one for another, iustifie, and approue one another, this is a good triall of our vprightnes indeede.</p>

So also the Israelites while God continued a good iudge amonge them <note place="margin">Iud. 2. 18. 19. 8. 9. 10.</note> were in some good order: yet <hi>when the iudge was dead, they returned, and did worse then their fathers.</hi> And so all the time of <hi>Ioshuaes</hi> gouernement, and the good elders, that suruiued <hi>Ioshua,</hi> they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues within some compasse. But together with them died all the Israelites goodnesse. <hi>Another ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration arose, which knew not the Lord;</hi> So strangely were they changed. And so wee see it is in many places from whence the powerfull ministery hath departed; how many that before seemed very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious haue then growen loose, and licentious. Children of good hope, vnder good parents, and gouernours, haue afterward prooued most vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and vngodly wretches. Sober, and modest maides vnder the straiter gouernement of parents, comming vnder the milder gouernement of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, haue prooued but bad wiues. And good wiues, during the watchfull eye of the carefull, and conscionable husband, haue proued after ward but wild, and wanton widowes. So many remouing out of religious families into ciuill, and out of ciuill into prophane, haue left behind them all their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ciuility, and growne openly prophane, and dissolute. Here then will be a good triall of our soundnesse, if in the absence and losse of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors we still continue the same that in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, performing that which <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth the Philippians, namely that whether he came among <note place="margin">Philip. 1. 27.</note> them, or were absent from them, yet they would still hold out in their good courses.</p>

And indeed there is no triall of meeknes, and patience till we be prouoked by iniuries. It is no triall of fidelity in a seruant, not to filch when his Masters eye is on him; but when opportunity serues his turne to play the thiefe, when he could purse his Masters money without his knowledge, then to bee faithfull is true faithfulnesse indeede.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19272:180"/> impatience did he show himselfe to bee? The like might be shewed in our other affections. Of them then take wee through notice, if wee will rightly iudge of our owne heartes. Doest thou feele that Christ is thy greatest ioy, sinne thy greatest sorrow, that when thou canst not feele the presence of the spirit in thy heart, thou goest mourning, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all other comfortes, assuredly as that holy Martyr said, <hi>If thou wert not a wedding childe, thou couldest neuer so heartily mourne for the absence of the Bridegroome.</hi> But alas if we examine our selues by this note, how much imperfection shal we discouer in our selues? How strong are our affections, both of ioy, and griefe, in thinges earthly? how weake in thinges spirituall?

                  <p>Of certaine notes which the worde of God giueth of an vpright heart.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter this discouery by the meanes, wee must <note place="margin">2. Marks to try the hearts sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, as</note> lay our hearts to the rule of the word, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them by those notes which there are giuen of an vpright and sincere heart. And these are many. I will name onely fiue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A sincere heart is an <hi>humble</hi> heart. An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall <note place="margin">1. Humility.</note> heart is alwaies proud, and vaine-glorious: As in the Pharisees <hi>Math.</hi> 6. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour said to them, <hi>How can ye beleeue, when ye seeke glory one of another?</hi> And so in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> seeking <note place="margin">Ioh, 5. 44. Acts, 8. 18. 2. King. 10. 16</note> his owne praise, and profit, in the desire of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall gifts. Whom therefore <hi>Peter</hi> told, that his heart was not vpright before God. In <hi>Iehu</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we may discerne the same spirit, when he saide to <hi>Ionadab, Is thy heart vpright, as mine?</hi> preferring himselfe before <hi>Ionadab.</hi> Whereas sincerity is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies better conceited of another, and very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and suspitious of it selfe. And so it will make a Christian, when he sees another, specially <hi>a Ionadab,</hi> to say to himselfe, Is my heart vpright, so as is his? Againe, <hi>Come,</hi> saies he, <hi>and see what zeale I haue for the Lord of hosts.</hi> Yea but sincere zeale desires not to be seen of any, saue him who seeth in secret. The Pharisees desire to bee seene of men, because they seeke the praise of men. Their lampes will not burne without this oile. Wind-mils they are, which will
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19272:181"/> not turne about to do any good seruice, without the wind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mens prayses. Hēce it is that they haue little zeal in prayer, vnlesse it be the publick, that so osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation &amp; vain▪glory may warme their harts. As in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, once it fared with one, that in the monastery could fast whole daies together with ease but in the desert he could not hold out vntil noon, but his belly would craue presently. Whereof when he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reason, this answer was returned him, that in the monastery the praise of men was in stead of meat to him, he fed there vpon it, which sustenance failing him in the desert, his fasting strength also fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But vnto sincerity her very obedience it selfe is meat and drinke. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 34. In other works, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker must haue meat, or else hee will not holde out in his worke. But vnto sincerity, her very <hi>worke</hi> is her <hi>meate.</hi> Hypocrisie, which is soone tyred at this work, without the refreshment of humane praises, well may it seeke for publique theaters: But sinceritie hides it selfe in the closet, and as in prayer, so in all good duties shuts the doore.</p>
               <p>And as the sincere hart is humble in regard of the end, wherat it aims in doing any good, namely Gods glory, not daring in any thing to seeke it selfe; so also in the manner of doing; not daring to trust it selfe, but affected with a thorough sense of it owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it resteth it selfe wholly vpon the power of God, to be perfected in her weakenes. <hi>Peter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in that wherein his heart was vnsound, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, shewed this spirit of pride, and vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in himselfe. For hee could not thinke that strength wherby he thought to stand was of Christ;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19272:182"/> because Christ flatly denied him his strength, and <hi>Peter</hi> neuer praied for it. And yet lo how confident he was? <hi>Though all men, yet not I;</hi> as though there had beene more in him, then in any other. Yea he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted Christ admonishing him of his frailty, &amp; as <hi>Marke</hi> notes, the more Christ warned him, the more confident and peremptory was he.</p>
               <p>Lastly, after the doing of euery good thing since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity stil remaines humble, and when men would dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs, it will not accept of any such honors, but sends <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 30. Act, 2. 12. and 14. 15. <hi>Nisi humilitas omnia quae bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>facimus et prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesserit, et comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur, et conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuta fuerit, et praeposita quam intuemur, et apposita cui ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haereamus, et imposita qua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primamur, &amp;c. Aug. epist.</hi> 56.</note> them back to the Lord, as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp; the Apostles. And thus, if we be sincere, in al things we do, there must be humility, <hi>preposed,</hi> in regard of the <hi>end</hi> we must look at, <hi>apposed,</hi> in regard of the <hi>māner</hi> of doing, <hi>imposed,</hi> after wee haue done, as a curb to restraine vs, least we reioyce not in the Lord but in our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this is a hard saying will some say, and if the case be thus, who then can be sincere? for who is there that is not tainted with pride, if not in al, yet in some of these three respects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is one thing for a mans eye to glance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a thing, another thing to fixe, and fully to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it selfe vpon it. Thoughts of pride and vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may <hi>rush</hi> into the hart of a sincere Christian: they <hi>rest</hi> onely in the heart of an hypocrite; who is set on worke onely by them in al his actions, and seekes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue contentment to them.</p>
               <p>I adde further, if sincerity bee not humble in this first kinde of humility, yet at the least, it is humble in an <hi>after-humility.</hi> If it haue beene ouerseene in the doing of any thing in pride, it is twise as humble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, because it was not hūble. A notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19272:182"/> betwixt sincerity, &amp; hypocrisie. There may be some kind of humility in hypocrisie, and of pride in sincerity: but hypocrisies humilty is followed with pride, and sincerities pride with humility. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humility is the better. And here only it is seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for vertue to come behinde vice. Hypocrisie is proud because it is humble: Sincerity is humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is proud. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a Thebane captaine the day after his victory, and triumph went drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and hanging downe the head; and being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked why he did so, answered, yesterday I felt my selfe too much tickled with vainglory; therefore I correct my selfe for it to day. The same is the spirite of the sincere Christian, of the true Israelite. As you may see in the example of <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> of whom it is thus written. <hi>His heart was lift vp—notwithstanding Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah humbled himselfe after his heart was lift vp.</hi> In a <note place="margin">2. Chr. 32. 25. 26.</note> sincere heart there must bee either the <hi>fore-humility,</hi> or the <hi>after-humility,</hi> which is the more seuere of the two; either the <hi>directing humility,</hi> for the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or else the <hi>correcting humility,</hi> for the erroneous manner of doing. If wee can follow the swing and sway of our owne proud, and vaineglorious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without all respect of Gods glory, and yet neuer be truly humbled afterward, this is palpable hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, wee haue not so much as the least dramme of sincerity: Which is many times more humbled for such mixtures, and defilements of good workes, then for some workes simply euill in themselues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The sincere heart is a <hi>good, and honest</hi> heart, <note place="margin">2 The good and honest heart.</note> as our Sauiour calls it. The honest heart is that, which cherisheth a vniuersall hatred of all sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19272:183"/> exception, and carrieth a constant purpose, and resolution in nothing willingly to sinne against God, but to indeuour it selfe to the vtmost, in euery good way of Gods commandements. Whatsoeuer it shall know to be a sinne, it will not purposely and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately doe it for all the world, it will not <hi>deteine the trueth in vnrighteousnesse.</hi> This note the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth. For hauing saide, <hi>Blessed are the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 3.</note>
                  <hi>in their way,</hi> hee teacheth vs to discerne them by this note, <hi>Surely they doe no iniquity.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, hee opposeth such as walke in any croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waies, to the vpright in heart. <hi>Do good O Lord to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal, 125. 4.</note>
                  <hi>those that are vpright in heart: but those that turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide by their crooked waies, &amp;c.</hi> It is the property of an hypocrite, to dispense with his conscience, at least for some one speciall, beloued sinne. As <hi>Iob</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other his characters makes this one, that hee <hi>holdes his wickednesse as a sweete thing in his mouth, &amp;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 20. 12.</note>
                  <hi>hideth it vnder his tongue, and fauoureth it, and wil not forsake it, but keepeth it close in his mouth.</hi> Now this honest heart, as it hates all sinnes, so at all times. Sometimes the vnsound heart will hate sinne, when there is no benefite by it, but if after it may chance to be beneficiall to our selues, then we loue it. Heere is a notable triall of sincerity, to preferre vertue before vice, then, when in humane reason vertue shall be the looser, vice the gainer. This note discouered false-hearted <hi>Iehu.</hi> He would not downe <note place="margin">2.

For in greater matters if we should not stand out, all the world would crie shame of vs. And heere it would he hard to say whether the shame of the worlde, or conscience of Gods commandement vrged vs. But in lessematters, the world rather will cry shame of vs, if we dost and out.

In this regard our Sauiour cals the Pharises hypocrites, and resembles them to painted sepulchres. Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, where nature ends. Nature in the framing of mans body begins first with the hart, and other such inward parts, and then in the last place comes to the face, and the outward parts. Thus is it with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, which is an artificiall kind of holinesse; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends in the outward face, and fashion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: The inward pith, the heart, and substance thereof it cannot attaine vnto. But the heart, and the purity thereof is the speciall thing the sincere Christian lookes vnto. Gods Israell is pure in heart, so that though sometimes the hand bee defiled, yet then the heart is not alike polluted, but still the true Israelite may say, <hi>My heart is awake, though mine eies sleepe.</hi> Whereas the base Israelite may say contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, My heart is a sleepe though my eies bee waking, <note place="margin">Cant, 5, 2.</note> and my tongue be walking.

               <p n="4">4. A sincere hart is alwaies most seuere against sin, where nature &amp; carnall respects wold teach vs to be mildest. As first to our selues. Indeed sincerity cannot indure sin in any, in it selfe least of all. An hypocrite will not indure the least sin in others, no not so much as a moat in his brothers; so sharp is he: in the meane time he can indure a beam in his own eye; so indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">Math. 7, 3.</note> is he to himselfe. <hi>Iudah</hi> could adiudge <hi>Thamar</hi> to the fire: vpon himselfe yet, being far deeper in that <note place="margin">Gen, 38, 24.</note> transgression, he could pronounce no such sentence. <hi>Dauid</hi> lay snorting in his owne sinne, when yet hee sentenced a proportionable sinne, related in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">2, Sam, 12. 5.</note> of another. Wherein hee bewraied want of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse. It was said of <hi>Antonie, hee hated a tyrant, not tyranny.</hi> It may as truly be said of an hypocrite, <note place="margin">tyrannum non tyrannidem.</note> he hateth sinners, not sinnes. For he nourisheth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in him, notwithstanding the rigor of his zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other mens sinnes. This is an ill signe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is. A good heart is ready to throw the first stone at it selfe, beeing slower in censuring others.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19272:186"/> None can say so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ainst it, but it selfe will bee ready to say much more.</p>
               <p>And as the sincere man will no more winke at his owne sinnes, then at anothers, so neither at theirs, to whom he is tied more by naturall and worldly res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, thē others, to whom he is not so tied. No more at his owne childrens, then at anothers, at his owne parents, then at another, at great and rich ones, then at the meaner ones, at friends to whom he is bound for, and depends vpon in hope of kindnesse, then strangers that haue no interest at all in him. Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is free from partiality. With <hi>Leui</hi> it knowes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther father, nor mother, neither King nor Kaesar.

Tell vs then, whether lawfull to giue tribute to him or no. Heere then was <hi>Ionathans</hi> sinceritie, <note place="margin">1. Sam, 19, 4, 5</note> when he condemned his owne Father, and that a King, in his proceedings against <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; defended <hi>Dauids</hi> innocency. Heere was olde <hi>Iakobs</hi> sincerity <note place="margin">Gen 49. Mark. 6, 18.</note> on his death bed, when fatherly affections are most liuely, so deepely censuring <hi>Reuben, Simeon, Leui</hi> his owne sonnes. Heere was <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptists sincerity, that he would not be silent, no not at <hi>Herods</hi> incest. Here was our Sauiours sincerity, that his mouth was not stopped with the Pharisees good cheere, but euen at their owne tables layed them out in their owne colours, and intertaines them with as many mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Luc, 9, 37, 42.</note> as they did him with dishes of meats. Here was the Beniamites vnsoundnes, that were ready with <note place="margin">Iudg. 20. 14.</note>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:19272:186"/> the sword to defend in their brethren such prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lustes, which they could not but condemne in their iudgements, &amp; in others no doubt would haue bin ready to haue punished with their swords. The Prophet ioyneth these two together, <hi>Thou art a God of pure eies, aad canst not beholde iniquity.</hi> So must it <note place="margin">Hab, 1, 13.</note> be with vs, if we will be pure &amp; sincere in heart, wee must behold no iniquity, no not in our selues, or those that are neerest vnto vs. For sincerity, as it loueth goodnes euen in the greatest enemy, so it hateth sin, euen in the greatest friend.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to omitte many other notes, sincerity sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <note place="margin">V. Reioycing &amp; grieuing for others gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; sins as well as our owne.</note> reioyceth in goodnes, &amp; in good things thēselues and the glory of God thence arising. Therfore as it grieueth for other mens sins, so it reioyceth in other mens obedience. Many are of a contrary spirit. They can be grieued for their owne sins, but not for other mens. Heere it is suspitious, we greeue not so much for Gods cause, for the dishonour our sins hath done to him (for then wee should greeue also at our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns sins, because they also staine Gods glory) but for our own sake, for fear, or feeling of some euil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to our selues by our sin: and such griefe argues rather selfe-loue, then any true loue of God. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they can be cheered, when they see Gods glory set forth by themselues in any good work: not alike, when by others. Nay rather they greeue at those good works of others, if of any marke, wherein they haue had no hand themselues. Like those Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, that said to <hi>Iptah, Wherfore wentst thou to fight</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iud, 12, 1.</note>
                  <hi>against the children of Ammon, and didst not call vs?</hi> But the sincere Christian, so God be truly glorified,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:19272:187"/> though it be without his help, yet reioyceth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thankes, nothing lesse, then if himselfe had bin the instrument. If any good thing be done, he doth not stand curiously inquiring of the authour; of his iudgment, of his affections, to find out something to imbase the work; but is glad that any glory is broght to God, or good to his Church, and with thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taketh his part of benefit thereout. Euen as in eating of meats, wee aske not where or how it was got, but fall to it; and in the shambles, the Apostle willeth not to inquire whether it had been sacrificed to the idol or no, but being good meat, and fit to be <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10, 27.</note> eat, without any more adoe to buy it. Thus <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> the good Israelite did not so stand vpon, or sticke at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but that he would go and try what our Sauiour was. And though the Philippick preachers <note place="margin">Ioh, 1, 47. Phil, 1. 18.</note> preached of enuy, and vaine-glorie, yet for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter soundly, their corrupt manner, what was that to <hi>Paul?</hi> that Christ was truely preached, he therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced, and would reioyce. It is not then sincerities palate, not to relish good meat, and wel cooked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we relish not the cooke.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue shewed both the meanes to discouer and notes to trie our false hearts by. And of the third illustration of the deceitfulnesse of the heart, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the vnsearchablenesse thereof, so much.</p>

                  </note> the middest of snares, not only neere them, but in the very middest of them, incompassed with them on euery side. Therefore let vs alwaies bee suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and iealous ouer our heartes, in all places, and vpon all occasions, in our solitarinesse, in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, in our businesse with men, in our dealings with God, in hearing, praying, meditating; in our dealings also with Sathan, in wrestling with his temptations. When the Philistimes were going out to warre against the Israelites, they durst not <note place="margin">1. Sam. 29.</note> let <hi>Dauid</hi> go with them; they had him in iealousie, because of the loue he bare to his owne Countrie,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:19272:188"/> and therefore put him out of the armie. Happy were it for vs in our spirituall warre with Sathan, if wee could as easily rid our selues of our naughty, deceitfull hearte, as they did themselues of <hi>Dauid.</hi> We haue farre greater cause to suspect our heartes, then they <hi>Dauid.</hi> The acquaintance of the flesh with Sathan, and Sathans interest in the flesh is greater then the Israelites in <hi>Dauid.</hi> Besides that they neuer had any experience of <hi>Dauids</hi> deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vnfaythfulnesse, as we haue had of the fleshes. Therefore I say it were well, if wee could wholy cashire this trecherous, and perfidious flesh. But since it stckes so close, as that we cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be shift of it, therefore we must alwaies haue an eye ouer it; euen as we would haue ouer an vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, pilphring seruant, who, not obserued, wil filch. For certainely such is the deceitfulnes of our harts, that if our eye be neuer so little off them, off goes the yoke of the Lord presently, and they break out into some vnlawfull liberty, or other. Keepe wee then our heartes, as <hi>Salomon</hi> counsels, fensed with a double gard, as the Iailer his close prisoner. See <note place="margin">Prou. 4.</note> the doores be fast locked. Yea looke to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, as <hi>Iob</hi> did. If there bee any open passage, this deceiuer will either let in some body to him, <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> which should not come in, or els he will out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. If we fall asleepe and neglect our watch, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Diuell, and his suggestions will enter; euen as when the sense of a vineyard is downe, then the wilde boare, and all manner of wild beasts come in, and deuour all: or else our hart it selfe will wander abroad, like a gadding <hi>Dinah,</hi> in the idle rouinges
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:19272:188"/> of her owne vaine imaginations. Thus then should we thinke with our selues euery morning, This day I am to venture into the world, and snares euerie where lie thicke, and threefould. If I take not heed, easily shal I be caught. For what alas is there wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart is not ready to deceiue me? I am now going to praier.

And how many are the temptations ready to incounter me? euen euery thinge I either see, or heare. If I see my enemie, in what danger am I of wrath, and malice? if my friend, flourishing, of enuie? poore, of disdaine? if a beautifull woman, of lust? If I heare rotten speach, how ready am I to bee corrupted with it? if reuiling, and iniurious, how ready am I to be prouoked with it? This is the cautelousnesse we must vse in all our occasions whatsoeuer. For all places are full of these snares, the streete, the house, the bourd, the bedde, the closet, yea the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19272:189"/> Church, the pulpit. The exhortation of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie, Watch thou in all thinges,</hi> is needfull; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 5.</note> the heart, deceitfull aboue all thinges, is also deceitfull in all thinges, euen in the best things that may be. And therefore Christ bids vs take heede to our heartes, euen in our almes, in our praiers, and <note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> other the holiest seruices, we can possibly performe for euen in them snares will bee set for vs. In these actions we had neede shut the doore of our heartes that our mindes steale not away from God. Neuer then trust thou this heart of thine, that it will bee well ordered, and kept in good frame, though thou cary not alwaies so heauy a hand and narrow an eye ouer it. No, if thou looke not thus straightly to it, it will be gone as a wild-horse, if a man once let goe the bridle, as hee is walking in his iourny. And then when he is once gone, hee will not bee gotten againe in hast; but a man must spend as much time in recouering of him, as would haply haue been sufficient to haue dispached the whole iourny. So will it fare with thy heart, if once thou let go this bridle of watchfulnesse. It will run out so farre, that it will bee long ere thou wilt catch it againe. It will be so frozen, that it will be long ere thou can bring it to melt. It will bee so loose, and idle, that it will be long ere thou canst worke it vnto true deuotion. And thou must spend as much time, nay more, in seeking to regaine thy heart againe, and to bring it into temper, and tune, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, then would haue serued for the good performance of the seruice it selfe. But aboue all thinges see thou trust not thine heart with such
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:19272:189"/> thinges as may bee dangerous occasions of euill. Looke better to it then so. Be as fearefull of this, as thou art of giuing a knife to a childe, or a sword to a mad-man. Thine eye cannot bee quick enough for thy heart then. The mad-man wil speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so soberly, and vse such faire persuasions to be vnfettered, and promise that he will be so quiet &amp;c. But no sooner is he loose, but he plaies reakes, woundes, slaies, destroies whatsoeuer is in his way, yea euen him that loosed him. So likewise deale our heartes with vs. They can flatter with vs, &amp; ô why should we trouble our selues so much, alwaies to be looking to them? and why should we deale so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, alwaies so to keepe them in, as a bird in a cage? to hold them so short of all liberty? why? they haue better gouernement of themselues, then that we need to feare them so &amp;c. But when once they haue gotte free, then they serue vs like the mad-man, so that we shall rue that time, that euer we gaue them such liberty.</p>

Euery slight occasion is in steade of a Perez vnto them. And yet lo the sillinesse of men; to beleeue their hearts that are so light of faith.

Thou hast this wisedome in the thinges of this life. Hauing to deale with a light, and inconstant man, when thou findest him in the good vaine, then thou wilt be sure to lay hold of that opportunity, and to take him then at his word. For thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, that if thou shouldest let him goe on neuer so little longer, within an houre, or two, he would be of another minde. Assuredly thy heart is far more variable, and vncertaine, then the ficklest man that can be. Doest thou then feele at any time, that thy heart is warmed with good motions, inlarged with good affections, lift vp to heauen in spirituall meditations, doest thou feele any sparkled of the heauenly fire; take thou the bellowes presently, blowe till they flame, cherish, and make much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the smoaking flaxe. Now is the time for thee, now I say, in this floate of good affections, when thy heart is so well prepared, to fall to praier, to confession of thy sinnes, to reading, to all the good exercises of repentance, and inuocation, and in a word to the doing of that good worke for the which motions, and desires are risen in thy minde. For how often haue the best of vs beene beguiled
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19272:191"/> here? to thinke we should do afterwards that which in present we purposed, and desired, and within an houre, or lesse, all our heat is gone, our affections are growne chil, and coole, our heats heauy, our spirits drousie, and dead, and so our selues wholly disabled for the dooing of that wee thought. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we stroke not the iron whiles it was hot, wee held not our hearts fast, when we had hold of them, we vsed not the meanes to keepe them still in good frame, and temper. And so all our good thoughts vanish, and come to nothing. Excellentlie <hi>Dauid, My heart O God is prepared.</hi> What? shall I suffer now <note place="margin">Psal, 57. 7.</note> other occasions to cal me another way? No: for then all that life and vigor which now I feele, wil be gone: but <hi>I will arise, and giue thanks,</hi> and so, I will arise and pray, arise and confesse, &amp;c. Oh if we would go to prayer in this spring-tide, as it were, of good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how then, as the Prophet speaketh, should wee <hi>poure</hi> out a praier? how would the riuers of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Esa, 26. 16.</note> teares ouerflow? whereas, neglecting this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, our praiers come but <hi>droppingly</hi> from vs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the ebbe of our affections.

They are like to glasses, that will bee hurt with a little breath, and vnto musicall instruments, that will be put out of tune with the least distemper of the aire. And therefore we had not need preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the opportunity, when we feele them wrought vpō in any sort by the holy spirit of God. What good impressions would they not receiue then, beeing so soft and tender? whereof afterward they will not be capable, being returned to their former hardnesse?

If wee would doe so, after once good affections are entred into our hearts, wee should euen locke vp the doore vpon them, that they could not get out againe, and so we should haue more of their company then now we haue; in stead of visiting vs now and then, they would become daily guests, and ordinary residenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries with vs. <hi>Salomon</hi> bids vs <hi>establish our thoughts by</hi>

                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:19272:192"/> This counsell-taking with God in praier, is the onely remedy against the deceitfulnesse of our heart, for the preseruing and establishing of all good thoughts and desires.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The deceitfulnesse of our hearts must cause vs <note place="margin">IV.

Let vs neuer therefore let rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings runne on, but euery day let vs make all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, let vs chastize our selues euery morning, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our seluer euery euening, euen in the still si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the night, as we lie waking on our beds.

But because both the word of God, and our owne experience haue sufficiently discouered their vnfaithfulnesse, therefore wee contrarily must say,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:19272:193"/> Let there be daily, yea hourely recknings kept with our hearts, for they deale exceeding vnfaithfully. The musitian because his instrument quickly growes out of tune, euen whiles he is in playing, therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then he will be tuning of it, as soone as hee spies the least iarring in any of the strings: so must wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixe the correction, and amendment of our hearts, (which is done by strict examination) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their vse, and imployment, and not to bee like the foolish mower, that still mowes, and neuer whets his sith.</p>
               <p>Lastly; since all our hearts naturally are so full fraught with guile, being so immeasurably and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchablie <note place="margin">V.

For they lay no other imputation on vs, then heere God himselfe doth, saying, <hi>The heart of man,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any, <hi>is deceitfull.</hi> So that the heart euen of the most holy, and regenerate is still in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceifull, as in part it is wicked.

               <p>THe <hi>motiues</hi> to incite vs vnto sincerity, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes of hart are many, &amp; powerfull, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole booke of God, some whereof I will vrge at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sincerity is the <hi>girdle,</hi> whereby all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are tied close vnto vs, So the Apostle in rhe des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the spirituall armour, cals it <hi>the girdle of truth.</hi> And therefore heere also is true that wee say, <hi>vngirt, vnblest.</hi> He is but a loose man, that wants this girdle. Let his gifts and graces bee neuer so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, <note place="margin">Ephes, 6, 14.</note> yet they sit but loose about him, when a storme comes they will easily bee shaken off. <hi>From him that hath not shall be taken away that he hath.</hi> From <note place="margin">Math, 13, 12.</note> him that hath not the gift of <hi>sincere sanctification</hi> shall be taken away those common gifts of an <hi>ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> and <hi>superficiary illumination,</hi> yea his showes also of true sanctification. Not onely that hee <hi>hath</hi> shall be taken away, but that also which he <hi>seemes to haue.</hi> The figge tree that onely made a show with leaues, <note place="margin">Luk, 18, 18.</note> hauing no fruit, in end, being cursed, lost the leaues
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:19272:194"/> to, wherewith it deceiued our Sauiour, and wholly withered. Gods gifts in an vnsound heart, contrary <note place="margin">Mark, 11, 20.</note> as it were to their owne nature, being peruerted to wrong ends, doe euen sigh vnder our abuse, &amp; God hearing their groanes giues them the wings of the Eagle, to flye away from such vniust possessours. How fearfull are the examples of many vnsoūd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, who notwithstanding all their goodly flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, haue yet vanished at last? they haue bin stript starke naked of all, their right hand hath forgot it skill, their right eye hath bene darkened, their arme <note place="margin">Psal, 137, 5. Ezech, 11, 17.</note> withered, they haue mouldred away, and become meere nothings, vnsauory salt fit for nothing but the dunghill. Christ hauing tolde the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> that hir graces were ready to dye, giues this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof. <hi>For I haue not found thy workes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel, 3, 2.</note>
                  <hi>before God.</hi> Therefore they are ready to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause tainted with the infection of hypocrisie. Had not <hi>Iudas</hi> many excellent graces of praier, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, miracles, &amp;c? yet, forasmuch as they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the salt of sincerity to preserue them from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, both he and they miserably rotted, &amp; came to fearefull desolation. His heart became a stye, and stable for Sathan to lodge in, &amp; to beget that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous conception of barbarous and trecherous villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. So that what the Psalmist speaketh concerning the wicked mans temporall estate, may truely bee spoken concerning the hypocrites spirituall estate. I saw him like the fresh lawrell, spreading himselfe, &amp; <note place="margin">Psal, 37, 35. 36</note> flourishing: but lo the roote being corrupt with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, he could not hold out. Inquire for him, and for his many graces, his great knowledge, his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19272:194"/> zeale, his forward alacrity, &amp;c. and lo their place cannot be found. The body when the soule is once gone, may not long stay aboue ground. It must needs be buried. So the hypocrites graces wanting sincerity, which is the very soule, &amp; life of all grace, they are but a stinking carrion, and what should an odious and ouglie loathsome carcase doe, but bee thrown into the pit? Standeth it not vs then in hand to looke to our selues that we be vpright in heart, if we would enioy the sweet comfort of our finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance? For, as excellently <hi>Bradford,</hi> the way of <note place="margin">In epist.</note> Christ is the straight way, and so strait, that as fewe can find it, &amp; few walk in it, so none can halt in it, but must needs goe vpright. For as the straitnesse will suffer no reeling to this side or that side, so if any mā halt, hee is like to fall off the bridge into the pit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall destruction. An vnsound horse that hath some secret fault, may carrie as good a shew as the soundest, and at the first for a mile, or two will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell as freshly and cheerefully, as any, but at length he tires, and giues ouer. So is it with an vnsound, &amp; deceitfull Christian. Notwithstanding all his faire beginnings, and hopefull entrances, yet hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues not. Let an apple seeme neuer so beautifull if it be rotten at core, it wil quickly putrifie. The house built on the sand cannot stand alwaies. If a tempest arise, downe it goes, it falls, and the fall thereof is <hi>great,</hi> like that of Ierusalem, which though it were <note place="margin">Math, 7.</note> a most glorious and godly city, yet it was wholly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, and leuelled with the ground, <hi>not a stone left vpon a stone.</hi> So great is the fall of these sandy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <note place="margin">Luc, 19. 44.</note> that it euen astonisheth them that knew them
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:19272:195"/> before, when they stood flourishing in their pride, &amp; beauty. So that heere also we may translate those words of the Prophet from the outward goods, and apply them to the inward graces of the wicked. <hi>Oh how horrible and suddenly are they consumed? Thou hast</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal, 73, 19.</note>
                  <hi>set them,</hi> and their graces too, <hi>in slippery ground, As a dreame they vanish &amp;c.</hi> And as they in the Prophet <note place="margin">Ezek, 28, 13.</note> lament <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> with the like lamentation may wee bewaile the pittifull ruines of the vnsound Christian. <hi>Thou hast beene in Eden, the garden of God, as one of the fairest trees thereof, Euery pretious stone</hi>

Thinke not now <note place="margin">Reuel, 3, 16.</note> that God will bee like thee, that as thou eatest vp thy vomit, so he will his, and suffer thee, after thou art once vomited, to come into his stomack againe.

It is the wont of the Lord to reward the sincerity of a litle grace with abundance of greater graces. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> before his coming to Christ, could haue no great knowledge, yet being a true Israelite, void of guile, Christ further in lightens him, giues him the sight of the true Messiah, not only bodily, but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 49. 50.</note> indues him with true faith, and promises him still greater matters. Alas the weake and dim knowledge that the poore Eunuch, and Cornelius had in the mystery of godlinesse: yet because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that poore measure of knowledge they had, they worshipped God sincerely, an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list <note place="margin">Acts. 8. &amp; 10.</note> was sent to the one, and both an Angell, and an Apostle to the other, bringing the reward of their
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:19272:198"/> sincerity in their handes, the clearer light of the Gospell, and a fuller largesse of spirituall giftes. For as the curse of God is vpon hypocrisie to decrease, and destroy a great deale, a great stocke of grace, so the blessing of God is vpon sincerity to increase the little stocke, the two mites, the graine of musterd seede of sincerity. So that as in the outward estate, so also in the inward it is true which the Prophet speaketh of the true child of God. <hi>A little vnto the righteous is better then great riches to the wicked</hi> For <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 16.</note> as Gods curse blowes vpon the great reue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">

Hence <note place="margin">Math. 25. 8.</note> it is that the vpright mans little portion of grace is better then the greater share of the hypocrite; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it thriues in his handes, and by his good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry quickly rises, the secret curse of God, as a moath, eating vp, and wasting the other.

Yea if his sincerity in his calling bee greater then theirs is in theirs, his comfort also shall be greater. For God regardes not so much the matter, as the forme of our obedience, not so much the thing that wee do, as the affection wherewith we do it. Where since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, there, in the meanest workes that are, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, the heart is giuen to God.

And so her heart being put to her mite gaue it weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the greater, but farre more hartlesse, largesse of the Pharise. Sincerity is to our workes, as spirit is to our bodies, maketh it farre better, then a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where there is more flesh, but lesse spirit. O rare and excellent vertue of sincerity which can make light drammes, and barly cornes as massie and ponderous, as the huge talents.

God lookes not so much to the way, as to thy foote in walking in the way. Let the way be neuer so meane yet no discomfort, if thou walke in it vprightly: let it be neuer so glorious, yet no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if thou walke in it haltingly.

But where there is likenesse of manners there easily will hearts be glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rivveted together. Now the vpright in heart are according to Gods owne heart, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saies, <hi>they are his delight.</hi> The Lord so loueth the truth in the inward partes, that hee himselfe with his owne mouth will commend, yea and admire the true Israelite. <hi>Behold a true Israelite,</hi>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:19272:201"/> said our Lord of <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> Though sincerity lurke with <hi>Saul,</hi> and care not for being beheld, yet God bringes it forth to light, and biddes others behold it. So true is that of the Apostle, that the true Iewes <hi>praise is of God.</hi> Was it thought such a matter for <hi>Achilles</hi> to haue the Poet <hi>Homer</hi> describer of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? O the glory then of the sincere Christian that shall haue God himselfe the trumpetter of his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? But he loathes, and abhorres the hypocrite, euen as the stomacke doth lukewarme water, hee distates him as much as he doth the grosse and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen offendours. Therefore it is that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

So out of conceit is God with hypocrisie. And this he shewes most apparantly, in that hee will not indure he should come neere him in any seruice, or sacrifice of prayer, or praise.

               <p n="10">10. Well, but this sometimes befals sincerity for it further triall to be denyed successe. God forbid yet that any one should be iudged an hypocrite for want of successe. This would argue want of charity &amp; iudgment? but lo see the misery of an hypocrite in the want of successe, and the happines of the sincere professor in the same case. For the one hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:19272:203"/> in the conscience of his sincerity: the other is vexed, and tormented with the guilt of his vnsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and taketh this punishment, as a iust rebuke thereof. The vnsound minister let his paines be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great, his preaching neuer so profitable, yet, if it take not, hath iust cause to lay the blame not vp-his hearers, but himselfe. For well may hee thinke with himselfe. How should I looke that god should grace words comming from a corrupt, and impure heart with the attendance of his holy spirit? But such ministers, as in the want of successe, are priuy to themselues of their owne sincerity, they may say with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 3. 4. 5. <hi>If our Gospell bce hid, it is hid to them that perish.</hi> Why so? <hi>For we preach not our selues, but Christ Iesus the Lord, and our selues your seruants for Iesus sake.</hi> Marke how the Apostle alleageth his sincerity in the discharge of his ministery as a reason of comfort, when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not; assuring himselfe vpon this ground that the fault was in the hearers themselues, and not in him, or in his preaching. The hypocrites successe then is either none at all, or comfortlesse, and so as good as none. For all the ioy of his successe is dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the conscience of his own hypocrisy. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the sincere Christian as he is vnder the promise of successe, and so often hath it: so when for iust causes God sees it not fitto accomplish this his promise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely conditionall, yet then hath he more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his <hi>successelesse sincerity,</hi> then the hypocrite for his life can haue in his most <hi>successefull</hi> and <hi>happiest hypocrisie.</hi> Yea the sincere Christian being a behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his successe oftens carries away al the comfort
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:19272:203"/> thereof, when the miserable hypocrite himselfe is left drye and destitute. The successe of a good work done in sincerity is specially comfortable to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker himselfe, aboue that it is to others. Contrarily, that comfort which is in the successe of an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall good worke is wholly others, the workeman himself hath not the least iot. Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> though <note place="margin">Phil, 1, 18.</note> the false Apostles were his aduersaries, and preached of enuy to vexe him, and thought little of prouiding matter of comfort for him, yet he reioyced in their preaching, and the fruit thereof.

For, let a man bee neuer so much deiected▪ this sinceritie will reuiue, and refresh his spirit, and put new life into him. Contrarily <hi>Peter,</hi> when he rushed, in the presumption of his deceitfull
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:19272:204"/> heart, into danger, without this fense and fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how dastardly a coward shewed hee himselfe? See how small a thing danted him; euen the words of a poore sillie wench. Who yet afterward, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with this armour, was so stout, and manly, that not the high Priest himselfe, nor all his prisons, nor punishments whatsoeuer, could any thing appall him; so in the afflictions sent by God, ô the releefe that then sincerity yeelds within, when all other things faile vs! This causeth vs to lift vp our heads with ioy; when others are at their very wits end for feare. The hypocrite in peace, and security may seeme strong and valorous; but let God by some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction dragge him out as it were by the eares from his lurking hole, and conuent him before his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and thou shalt not see any thing more abiect or hartlesse.

And therefore he said, <hi>Vntill I dye I will neuer take away my innocency from my selfe.

               <p>Here then happily some, feeling the want of this <note place="margin">Meanes to get sincerity.</note> so necessary a grace, will inquire concerning the <hi>Meanes</hi> to attaine thereto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first meanes</hi> is for a man alwaies to possesse his heart with the apprehension of Gods presence, and so to keepe it in his feare continually, <hi>to walke</hi> as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen, 5. Heb, 11. Gen, 17, 1.</note> did, <hi>with God,</hi> as being in his eye, and with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> seeing him that is inuisible. <hi>Walke before me▪</hi> saith God to <hi>Abraham, and be vpright.</hi> First, <hi>Walke before me,</hi> set thy selfe in my presence, behold my all seeing eye, that seeth in the darke, euen in the darkest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the heart, and then <hi>bee vpright.</hi> This appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Gods presence will quash, &amp; crush euen the very first risings of hypocriticall thoughts. What? God sees me, and shall I dare to dallie with him? If but a man, nay if but a child could looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my heart, I durst not deale dubbelie, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. How then may I dare to do so, when the God of heauen is present, and beholds me? Hypocrisie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from the secret Atheisme of the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he saith. Tush none seeth. And in this regard <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5, 9.</note>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:19272:205"/> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> a paire of noble hypocrites are said to <hi>tempt God</hi> in their hypocrisie, that is to make triall of him, whether he were present euery where or no, and so knowing all things were able to reueale their hypocrisie. And for the same cause did <hi>Peter</hi> tell them, that they lied <hi>not to men, but to the holie ghost,</hi> because they thought they were out of Gods hearing, and onely <hi>Peter,</hi> and they with him, heard them. Therefore the Church in the Psalmes shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how they were kept in their sincerity, from dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling falsly in their couenant with God; because they <note place="margin">Psalm, 44.</note> remembred that God would search it, as beeing the searcher of the heart. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> notably ioynes these two together, <hi>Wee make not merchandise of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2, Cor, 2, 17.</note>
                  <hi>word of God,</hi> We play not the hucksters with it: <hi>but as of sincerity, as of God in the sight of God speak wee in Christ.</hi> It is impossible for a man to speak as in Gods presence, and not to speake sincerely.</p>
               <p>A second meanes is diligently to reuiew all our workes of obedience, as one God did his of creation and to obserue the peace and comfort of conscience which we finde, when we do good things with good hearts, as on the contrary the trouble and disquiet of mind, when we do otherwise. And withall, when we take our selues thus tardie, in a holy indignation to take reuenge of our selues, iudging and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selues before the Lord. The very thinking of the after-reckonings we must come to, when wee haue done our worke, will make vs take heede how we do it. For who is there that vseth for all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at the daies end to call himselfe to a seuere exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as the hard Master doth his seruants, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:19272:206"/> must not needes, in the very middest of his actions reason thus with himselfe? Anon all this which now I doe, must very narrowly be looked ouer, if it be not done faithfully and sincerely, I shall smart for it then; O the wrings and secret pinches which mine owne guilty heart will giue mee; yea the lashes which by mine owne couenant, I am tied to giue my selfe, in case my worke bee found blurred with hypocrisie? It stands me in hand therefore to looke to it, that though my worke by reason of my weake skill, be but meane, yet it may be cleane, though it be not fine, yet it may not be foule, being soyled, and slubbered with the slurre of a rotten heart.</p>
               <p>A third meanes is true humiliation of spirit. For where this is, there must needes be the deniall of our And where there is true deniall of our selues, there is not hypocrisie; which testifieth a man euen in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God to seeke himselfe, and in preaching Christ to preach himselfe. And therefore the Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his owne sincere, to others deceitfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, saith, <hi>We preach not our selues, but the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> This is the ground of all vnsoundnes in religion, this want of humbling and denying our selues. For hence it comes to passe, that wee are so caried and swaied, euen in our best actions, with the respects of our owne praise, and profit. Therefore S. <hi>Luke</hi> notes that the wise builder, that▪ is the sincere Christian, <hi>digges deepe,</hi> namely in a deepe humiliation of his <note place="margin">Luk, 6, 48.</note> owne soule, whereas thee foolish builder, that is the hypocrite; <hi>builds without a foundation,</hi> that is, enters vpon the profession of religion without euer being truely humbled, and cast downe for his sinnes. And
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:19272:206"/> hence the building comes to bee vnsound, because vnfounded. That the heart then may stand vpright <note place="margin">Non est cor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum nisi sit scissum.</note> before God, it must first as it were make it selfe croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked instooping and bowing it selfe vnder his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand in the exercises of humiliation. That the heart may be whole, it must first bee rent and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Corrupt and impure gold cannot be defecated and rid of the drosse, till it be molten, and dissolued. Vnsound bodies full of vitious humors cannot come to any good estate, till they be well emptied by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Crooked things cannot be made strait with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wringing of the hand. Humiliation is that which melts vs, purges vs, wrings vs, and so makes vs of drossie pure, of foggie sound, of crooked straight Christians. Doest thou then desire to bee a sincere Christian indeede, a true disciple of Iesus Christ, to be freed of all vnsound mixtures? thou must first be broken and battered in peeces, by the humbling hand of God; thou must remember thy Masters rule, <hi>I any man will bee my disciple, let him denie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly; sincerity being opposed to mixture, as the <note place="margin">Sincerum, sine certa. Donat.</note> notation of the word teacheth, that which clenseth our hearts from the defilement of such mixtures, must needes make vs sincere. Now it is faith which <note place="margin">Acts, 15.</note> purgeth, and purifieth the heart. Faith then appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the sincerity of Gods loue in Christs death to vs, and beholding there how Christ gaue his hart to be pierced for vs, cannot hut make vs returne the like sincerity of heart and affection to God. <hi>Thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnes,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid, is euer before mee,</hi> namelie <note place="margin">Psalm, 26, 3.</note> by the apprehension of my faith, <hi>therefore haue I</hi>

                  <hi>walked in thy truth.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that it was this loue of Christ towards him, which by his faith hee apprehended, and applied to himselfe, that made him deale so sincerely, and seeke onely Gods glory, euen then, when to the world, he might seeme to be madde of pride, and vaineglory in preferring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before the false Apostles. <hi>Whether we be madde</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2, Cor, 5. 13. 14 opened.</note> saith hee, <hi>we are madde to God.</hi> That is, when I thus commend my selfe, and boast of mine owne mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery against others, and in so doing seeme madde to you, yet then I respect not my selfe in so doing, but onely God and his glory; <hi>or whether wee are in our right mind,</hi> that is, vse such courses as to you seeme wiser, <hi>we are it to you.</hi> Wee doe it faithfully for your good. Now marke what it was which made him to doe so. <hi>For the loue of Christ constraineth vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we thus iudge, that if one be dead for al, then were al dead. And he died for all, that they which liue should not henceforth liue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but to him that died for them.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The answering of the obiection which the deceitfull heart of man might gather out of the former doctrine of the heartes deceitfulnesse.</p>

               </q>
               <p>THis verse dependeth vpon the former, as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret preuention of an obiection which vpon occasion of the former doctrine of the heartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse the wicked Iewes might make against the Prophets threatnings, in this manner. If the heart be so immeasureable, and vnsearchably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, that none can know it, then we trust to do well enough, for all the inward wickednesse, and hypocrisie of our heartes. For if none do know it, then none can punish it. The Lordes answere is, as if he should more largely thus haue spoken. Nay soft a while, you runne to fast. The heart cannot be knowne of any creature, but I the Lord, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, haue a priuiledge aboue all creatures, throughly, and perfectly to know the inmost cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of your heartes. And therefore neuer thinke that the closenesse, and secrecy of your corruption shall free you from punishment; for my knowledge of your hearts is not an idle, and vaine knowledge, but therefore doe I know them, that, thereafter as I shall see their inward soundnesse, or falsenesse, so I may dispense my rewardes, and punishments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This is the cohaerence.</p>

And withall an <hi>anthropopathy,</hi> that is a manner of speach, whereby God, for our better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is made affected like man. For God needes not any searching, to come to the knowledge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, as mens ignorance doth: But because mens knowlegde is best there, where the greatest triall, and search hath beene made, therefore vnder this phrase it pleaseth the Lord to signifie his full, and absolute knowledge. <hi>Heartes, and reines.]</hi> That is, both thoughtes, and affections, the raines being the seate of the strongest affection, namely that which is for generation.

               </p>
               <p>To beginne with the first. It is the constant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:19272:208"/> of the scriptures euery where that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God alone of himselfe, <hi>throughly,</hi> and <hi>exactly</hi> to knowe the secretes of the heartes of men. And therefore denying this knowledge to all others in the former verse, <hi>Who can know it?</hi> here he chaleng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to himselfe, I the Lord know it. But I say, 1. <hi>Of himselfe.</hi> Because by reuelation from him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may know. As Christes humanity <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2 24. <note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 24.</note>
                  <hi>But Iesus did not commit himselfe to them. For he knew them all. And had no neede that any should testifie of man. For hee knew what was in man.</hi> So also the Prophets. As 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 19. <hi>I will tell thee</hi> (saith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul) all that is in thy heart.</hi> No maruaile, when God had <note place="margin">1.

Thus <hi>Elisha</hi> saw the hollow, and hypocriticall heart of <hi>Gehezi, (Went not mine heart with thee in the way)</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Zap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings. 5.

                  <hi>heart of man is like deepe water but a man of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will draw it out.</hi> Here euen naturall wisedome is compared to a bucket, which is able, being let downe into the deepest well, to bring vp the waters thereof. So though the heart of many men be full

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Salomon</hi> afterward in this capter, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing said that <hi>a wise King scattereth the wicked, and causeth the wheele to turne ouer them,</hi> because it might be said, how can he do so, since wicked men haue so many couers for their wickednes to hide it from the eyes of the world? he addeth, as answering this obiection, <hi>The soule of man is the light of the Lord, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 26. 27</note>

But now Gods eye needes no <note place="margin">Solus Deus solā nescit ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiā. Et totus videt, &amp; totū, quia minimè fallitur, quia minimè claudr, quia extra se lumen nō quaerit vt videat. Ipse enim est qui vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, &amp; vnde videt.

For hee hath a fiery, and flaming eye, which is both the <hi>organe,</hi> and the <hi>meane</hi> of seeing, ministring light to it selfe, to discerne all thinges. Whence it is, that, as the Psalmist excellently saith, he knoweth our thoughtes, <hi>a farre off,</hi> long before there go any outward signes in the face to bewray them. According to that which the Lord speaketh of himselfe concerning his knowledge of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites heartes; <hi>I know his thoughts euen now, what hee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 139. 2.</note>
                  <hi>will doe, before I bring him into the land which I sware.</hi> Whereas the wisest men know them onely when <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 21.</note> they are neere at hand, when they are ready to breake out at our faces, eyes, mouthes. So that in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:19272:209"/> this regard wee may iustly vse that of the Prophet, Am I God neere hand only, &amp; not also a farre off. <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 23.</note> Yes Lord thou must needes bee a God a farre off, who knowest our thoughtes so farre off, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know them our selues, yea before euer we had any being our selues. Whereas we pore-blind creatures cannot see the heart, vnlesse we may pore vpon it, hauing it laid neere our eyes in outward signes; and yet neither then can we see it otherwise then the man in the Gospell saw men walking as trees. Thou seest the deceits of the heart, with an vnerring and vndeceiuing eye. We with an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and erroneous. As our heart is deceitfull, so our eye also in seeing, and iudging of the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, so that it cannot, when it is at the cleerest, giue any infallible, definitiue sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any mans heart, but only probable, by way of diuining. But in this coniecturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the angels specially excell, by reason their eies pierce deeper then ours, euen to the sight of the inward partes of our bodies, as well as of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thogh yet in the outward they are able to see far more, then we. Hence <hi>Dauid</hi> for his wisedome in finding out of secrets cōpared to an angell of God, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 14. 20.</note> by the woman of <hi>Tekoa.</hi> The Diuell therefore may be able to giue a shrewd gesse at our thoughtes, the rather for that he himself often suggesteth thoghts vnto vs, &amp; hath liberty giuen him to come, though not into the priuy chamber, of the soule, yet into the outward chmaber, the fansie, &amp; to work vpon those phantasms, which ther he finds. Neuertheles he cannot directly, and certainly set downe what
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:19272:210"/> our owne secret thoughtes be, but still this doctrin remaineth true, onely God of himselfe, exactly knowes the secrets of the heart. There is indeede a great mingle mangle, and confusion of thoughts, euen as there is of drosse, and good metall in siluer and gold, which lie so confused together, that to the eye of man the drosse is not discernible. But when they are in the furnace, and fining potte, then we may see them both distinctly. That which is the furnace to the gold, the fining pot to the siluer, the same, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is the Lordes flaming eie to the heart of man; euen in the middest of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">Pro. 17. 3.</note> shuffles, and confusions, it is a notable distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisher, cleerely discerning the bad from the good, the baggage, and refuse from that which is good and fine, though they be neuer so troublesomely jumbled together. And no marueill; for euen <hi>hell,</hi> (a place farre deeper, then the heart <hi>Luke.</hi> 8. 31. <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 11.</note> farre vaster, and wider, being of so infinite receit, that able to hold all the damned soules and bodies, <hi>Esay.</hi> 30. 33.) <hi>and destruction,</hi> (the infinite paines <note place="margin">Isay. 30. 33.</note> of this hell) which (as the Prophet speaketh of heauens ioyes) eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, nor the hart of man once able to apprehend the thousand part of them) <hi>are open to the eyes of the Lord, how much more then the heartes of the children of men.</hi> And hereof the scriptures giue a double rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Gods omnipresence. If a man could be in any place where God were not, hee might escape the sight of his eye. But, <hi>can any man</hi> (saith the Lord) <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 24.</note>
                  <hi>hide himselfe in secret places that I shall not see him. Doe</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:19272:210"/>
                  <hi>not I fill heauen and earth.</hi> This reason <hi>Dauid</hi> persu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth notably <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. throughout.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Gods forming of the heart. He that made the eye shall not he see? the eare, shall not hee heare? the heart shall not he vnderstand? Artificers know the nature, and properties of their workes: And shall God onely be ignorant of his workmanship? This reason also <hi>Dauid</hi> vrgeth in the same Psalme, vers. 12. 13. <hi>The darkenesse hideth me not from thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 139. 12. 13.</note>
                  <hi>For thou hast possessed my reines, thou hast couered mee in my mothers wombe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these 2. reasons I adde a 3. namely that God is the preseruer, and vpholder of the heart. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>In him we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing.</hi> Which is <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> to bee vnderstood as well of the motions of the mind in thoughtes and desires, as of the body. The mind is borne vp by God, euen in the act of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, farre otherwise then the earth beareth vs in walking. Therefore it cannot bee but God must needes perceiue the motions of our mindes, euen as the senselesse earth, if it had sense, must needes perceiue the motions of our bodies.</p>
               <p>The vse, 1. This serueth to assure our faith, that the scripture is the word of God. For it is proper onely to God to know the secretes of our heartes. But the the scriptures doe notably lay open the close corruptions of our heartes vnto vs, insomuch as we must needes be forced with the vnbeleeuing idiot to fall downe on our faces, and to say, <hi>verily God is here,</hi> it is he that speaketh. And as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when she heard Christ discouer her secret adultery, then she gaue ouer wrangling,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:19272:211"/> and went to her neighbours, saying <hi>Come and see a man, that hath told me all that euer I haue done, is not hee the Messiah?</hi> so wee, seing our hearts so liuely deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered vnto vs in the scriptures, may in like sort cry out one to another, come, and see a booke, that tels vs all that is in our heartes. Must not this needs be his booke who only knoweth the heart? Besides that as the scriptures do detect our thoughts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, so some particular mens in speciall. As, what was <hi>Hamans</hi> proude thought, when the King asked him what should bee done to the man hee would <note place="margin">Ester. 6. 6.</note> honour, what was <hi>Micals</hi> despightfull thought, when she sawe her husband dancing, what was <hi>Sauls</hi> murtherous thought, when <hi>Dauid</hi> played on the harpe before him, what was <hi>Felix</hi> couetous thought when he talked priuately with <hi>Paul,</hi> what was the <hi>Pharisees</hi> detracting thought, when the woman wiped our <hi>Sauiours</hi> feete at the table. These persons had so much wit as to keepe their owne counsell, and in many of them shame must needes be of force to keepe them from blabbing their own secrets, and vncouering their owne filthy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. How then is it possible for vs to imagine how the writers of those histories should come to the knowledge of such secret, otherwise, then by the reuelation of the spirit of God?</p>
               <p n="2">2 This must teach vs in confession of our sinnes not to conceale any thing, but to poure out our soules like water, for God hath a darting, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing eye that sees the very bottome of our heartes. This vse <hi>Ioshua</hi> made of this doctrine to <hi>Achan,</hi> when God by lot had detected him, <hi>My sonne giue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 7. 19.</note>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:19272:211"/>
                  <hi>glory vnto God,</hi> namely the glorie of his omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou seest already the depth of his knowledge <note place="margin">Iosh, 7, 19.</note> is greater then the depth of thine owne deceitfull heart, confesse thy sinne therefore vnto God, euen the whole circumstance of the matter. A malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Et tibi quidem Domine, cuius oculis nuda est abyssus humane conscientiae, quid occultū es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set in me, etiāsi nollem confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in truth when wee goe about to hide any thing, wee <hi>rather hide God from our selues, then our selues from God,</hi> we put out our owne eies, not Gods.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This must cause vs to bee sincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in all the duties of godlinesse. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. 4. <hi>We handled not the word of God deceitfully, wee speake not as they that please men, but God which trieth the hearts.</hi> So the Church Psal. 44. 18. 19. 20. 21. After the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their integrity euen in the midst of heauie persecutions giueth this as the reason of this their so doing, <hi>If we haue forgotten the name of our God, and holden vp our hands to a strange God, should not God search this out, for hee knoweth the secrets of the heart.</hi> When something we are to doe must be subiect to the censure of some speciall wise, iudicious man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how doth the sharpenesse of his iudgement skare vs, and what care, and circumspection vse wee in such cases? well all our actions whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer must come vnder Gods scanning, and they must abide the censure of that pure and seuere eye that cannot behold the least iniquity. And shall we nothing reuerence, or respect this eye? Shall wee take no care how to please it? O that wee could but bring our selues once to giue that respect to Gods eye which we doe to mans. It is true indeede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:19272:212"/> condēneth eyeseruice in seruants to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. But yet this eyeseruice to men shall condemn our want of eyeseruice to God: &amp; would to God by their example, we could learn to perform eyeseruice to God. The seruant though he worke idly, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zily, when his masters eye is off him, yet painefully when it is on him. Gods eye is alway on vs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee had that respect of our heauenly master, which of our earthly, we should alwaies performe obedience to him. Eyeseruice, performed to God, must needs be lasting, &amp; continuing seruice. If thou canst finde a time when Gods eye is off thee, I will then giue thee leaue to giue ouer thy worke, or to worke vntowardly: but since Gods eye is alwaies on thee, why is not thy eye also alway on him, as <hi>Enochs</hi> was; why walkest thou not as in the presence of this God? Why labourest thou not in all thy seruices to approue thy selfe to this eye that seeth in secret, and is able by it owne christ all brightnesse to discouer the smallest mote of hypocrisie in the blindest nook of thy hart? that so when it shall come to take a view of them, it may giue witnesse to them, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, though not, as once those solely his owne in the creation, for very good, yet for good in part, for good sincerely, though not good perfectly. This vse <hi>Dauid</hi> made of this doctrine to himselfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 168. <hi>I haue kept thy precepts,</hi> namely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, <note place="margin">Psal, 119, 168.</note> and sincerely, <hi>for all my waies are before thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. This must restraine vs euen from secret sins, which we might commit without the priuily of any other. For wheresoeuer thou art, there is an eye that sees thee, an eare that heeres thee, a hand that

By this argument <hi>Salomon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth from adultery, which for the most part is committed in the night. <hi>Iob.</hi> 24, 15. because all the waies of men are open, &amp; naked to Gods eies. What horrible Atheisme doth this argue, that the presence <note place="margin">Pro, 5, 21.</note> of a little childe shall hinder vs from the dooing of some wickednesse when Gods presence cannot? but as our Sauiour speaketh concerning killing, so I of seeing, feare not them that can see the body onely, but feare him that can see the soule also, to whome night and light, day and darknesse all one, who can as easily see thee in the dead darknes of the night, as at high noone in the cleerest sunshine, as well when the candle is out, as when sighted, him I say feare. If wee did beleeue this vbiquity of Gods eye, how would it quash the very first risings of euill thoughts in our heatts? The eye of man drawes from vs a care of our outward behauiour, why then should not the eye of God draw from thee a care of the inward behauiour of thy hart? since God sees thy heart, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then man thy face, and vnderstands thy thoughts better then man thy words. Little children, when in the middest of their disorders they spye once their fathers eye, they are hushed presently. So should it bee with vs when through forgetfulnesse of this all-seeing eye of our heauenly Father continually ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking vs, our hearts haue begun to breake loose, and to sport themselues in vaine, and idle thoughts, and desires; then should wee consider tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> all this while Gods eye hath beene fixed on vs; Wretches then that wee are that haue had our Fathers eye to bee a witnesse of our misdemeanour! Then in this
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:19272:213"/> case should this spiritual eye of God worke the same effect in vs which once the bodily eye of Christ, in <hi>Peter.</hi> It should euen dash vs, and shame vs in the middest of our sinne. If being in the sight &amp; presence of our betters, whose grauity and authority clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth speciall reuerence at our hands, wee yet, not knowing of it, haue beene otherwise in our speech and behauiour, then became vs, wee no sooner see them, but are ashamed presently, &amp; are ready to cry them mercy. Should we not do the like much more, when wee haue offended &amp; greeued the holy eye of the Lord with any vndecent behauiour, though but of our hart only? Should we not say as once <hi>Iakob</hi> in Bethel, (since God is present in all places, as well as in Bethel, though not with so speciall a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) <hi>Surely God is heere, and I was not aware of it.</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. This doctrine is full of sweete comfort, and that in sundry cases. 1. In the peruerse iudgement of men often vnder valuing of vs, and depressing vs far beneath our inferiours. As the Corinthians did <hi>Paul</hi> vnder their shallow headed verbalists, not worthy to carry his bookes after him for sound and substantiall learning. Our comfort heere is this, that God seeth not as man seeth, iudgeth not as man iudgeth, by the <hi>seeing of the eye,</hi> by the <hi>hearing of the eare,</hi> by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. Es. 11.</note> apparances. Whence it comes to passe, that when the false and iniudicious eye of man, too too much affected with outward showes, hath preferred bold <hi>Thrasoes</hi> before their betters, that cannot in like pompous ostentation set forth themselues, and hath adiudged preeminence rather to <hi>Eliashibs</hi> outward person, then <hi>Dauids</hi> inward parts, yet God comming after reuerseth and repealeth this vnrighteous iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thrusting downe proud ignorance from the head of the table to the foote, and lifting vp humble knowledge from the foote to the head. Thus Paul relieued himselfe when he was thus disparaged by the Corinthians. <hi>I passe not saith hee to bee iudged of you.</hi> I measure not my selfe by any mans iudgement. <hi>He that iudgeth mee, is the Lord.</hi> Wherefore as wee haue no reason to flatter our selues, when men flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vs, so neither alwaies to discourage our selues, when men discourage vs. As mens <hi>praises</hi> must not <hi>tickle</hi> vs, so neither alwaies their <hi>dispraises</hi> trouble vs. For true, both praise and dispraise is from God, who
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:19272:214"/> searcheth the heart, and trieth the raines. Heed not then mens judgement ouermuch, but against their blacke coles, comfort thy selfe with Gods white stone. 2. Here hence also we may gather comfort in false imputations and slanders. As this was <hi>Iobs</hi> comfort in the aspersion of hypocrisie, <hi>my witnesse is in heauen, and my record on high.</hi> 3. It steedeth also for comfort in the preuailings of the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, and that vnder colour of right, Psal. 7. 9. <hi>O let the malice of the wicked come to an end. But guide</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 7. 9.</note>
                  <hi>thou the iust. For the righteous Lord searcheth the harts and the reines.</hi> And therefore hee seeth the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and sincerity of the one, the fraud, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of the other, notwithstanding all their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wordes. <hi>The eies of the Lord looke downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chr. 16. 9.</note>
                  <hi>to shew himselfe strong to them that are of a perfitte heart,</hi> namely in the end at least, euen when they are most weake in thēselues, to giue thē the victory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly But most cordiall is that consolation which this doctrine ministreth in our temptations, and inward conflicts with <hi>Sathan,</hi> and our owne consciences, crying out against vs, that we are not that which others, and our selues haue thought, that wee haue not so much as the least dramme of any goodnesse. And indeede, in temptation, our sins often present themselues in such a multitude, that they wholy intercept from our eyes the sight of grace. Yet here, in the defect of our owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we must comfort our selues with Gods; and say with <hi>Ezehiah,</hi> in that his grieuous triall, <hi>O Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 38. 3. Ioh 21. 15. 16.</note>
                  <hi>thou knowest</hi> I <hi>haue walked with a perfit heart before thee.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter,</hi> when Christ lay grating vpon him with
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:19272:214"/> that threefold interrogation, <hi>Simon louest thou mee,</hi> thereby renewing the bitter memory of his three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold deniall, and in effect saying thus much, How can I thinke that thou who hast so often denied me doest loue me? he yet susteined himselfe with this meditation of Gods knowledge; <hi>Lord thou knowest all thinges, thou knowest that I loue thee.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sheweth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. that sometimes, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of affliction, we are so confounded in our selues, that though indeed we do pray in our secret sighes, and sobs, yet we perceiue not that wee pray. For so I take it that text may be read, <hi>wee know not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26. 27.</note>
                  <hi>what we pray,</hi> the flesh with her murmurings makes such a dinne that we can hardly heare the voyce of the spirit mixing with the fleshes roaringes and repinings, his praying sighes and sobbings. But because a poore soule would hence discomfort it selfe, and thinke what good will such confused prayers doe mee, which I scarse discerne my selfe? the Apostle answereth notably, opposing to this obiection the comfort of this doctrine of Gods knowing the heart. <hi>But he that searcheth the hearts he knoweth the meaning of the spirit.</hi> Marke how he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth Gods knowing of our prayers to our owne not knowing. As if hee should say. Let not this trouble thee, that thou cannest not perceiue that thou praiest. Do not therefore thinke thou canst not, thou doest not pray. For though thou know not what it is thou praiest, yet God the searcher of the heart, who is greater then thy heart, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and approueth also thy praier. Discourage not then thy selfe ouer-much in the want of feeling of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:19272:215"/> grace in thy selfe. Remember that God sees, as that euill, so also that good, which sometimes thou seest not in thy selfe. And therefore as thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test not to bee ouer confident in the not feeling of sinne in thy selfe, but to say with the Apostle, <hi>though I know nothing</hi> (that is no euill) <hi>by my selfe, yet I am not thereby iustified;</hi> so neither to bee too farre deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the not feeling of grace, but by like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to say, <hi>Though I know no good in my selfe, yet am I not thereby condemned.</hi> So much of the first point, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 4.</note> Gods knowledge of the heart: The second follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the end of this knowledge, <hi>That I may giue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man according to his waies &amp;c.</hi> The which words we will consider first in their reference to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, secondly, apart by themselues.</p>
               <p>Out of the former consideration we learne</p>
               <p n="1">1 That good and euill thoughtes, and desires, in Gods account, are good and euill workes. For God here sayeth hee taketh through notice of the heart, that he may recompence men according to their workes. Thereby implying, that if he did not see the heart, there must needs scape many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thoughtes, &amp; desires vnpunished, many good ones also go vnrewarded; and so hee should not be able to giue to euery work his proper recompence, namely to the inwarde workes of the heart, the thoughtes and desires thereof. Concerning euill thoughtes, <hi>Peters</hi> speach is excellent to <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus. Pray to God that if it bee possible the thought of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8. 22.</note>
                  <hi>thy heart may be forgiuen thee.</hi> Forgiuenesse presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth desert of punishment▪ punishment an euill worke meriting it: for punishments are only awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:19272:215"/> to workes. For good thoughtes and desires <hi>Pauls</hi> speach is excellent, <hi>It is God that</hi> worketh <hi>both</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip 2. 15.</note>
                  <hi>to will and doe.</hi> If both be his owne workes, the desire as well as the deede, he must needes loue, and like both the one, and the other. This maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that make no bones of euill thoughts, as though no other euill workes then such as bee outward. 2. It serueth for comfort to the children of God, disabled sometimes by want of outward helpes, or otherwise, for the performance of some kind of outward obedience. These must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how highly God apprizeth good purposes, and desires, accepting, and rewarding them, when they come to him, as if they came accompanied with the deeds themselues. <hi>Dauid</hi> did but conceiue a purpose to build God a house. God rewarded it with the building, and establishing of <hi>Dauids</hi> house 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 16. he did but conceiue a purpose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinne. Gods eare was in his heart, before <hi>Dauids</hi> confession could be in his tongue <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. The poore beggers that haue wanted foode for themselues Christ yet shall say at the last day, yee haue fed me, when I was hungry, onely in regard of their stronge affection, if they had had ability. The prodigall child, when he was but conceiuing a purpose of returning, was preuented by his father first comming to him <hi>Luc.</hi> 15. 20. and <hi>Isay.</hi> 65. 24. God will <hi>answere vs before we call,</hi> that is, in our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of praier. O sweete comfort! when wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our selues to prayer in our priuate meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bethinke our selues of our sundry wantes, we purpose with our selues to begge such, and such
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:19272:216"/> things. Whereof yet haply we forget some in the vocall praier. Shall any good soule now think that the memories weaknesse shall any thing preiudice her in this case? no, thy purpose of asking the thing forgotten was a most effectuall asking of it, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee belongeth the comfort of that saying. <hi>I will heare before they call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That God esteemeth of the goodnesse of our outward workes by our hearts. Therefore here he saith that he first searcheth the heart, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense the worke. If God iudged of workes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the outward matter of them, there needed then no looking into the heart, for the iust dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of rewardes, and punishments. Now there are two thinges more especially in the heart, whereby God judgeth of our workes. 1. Faith, which clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the heart, and maketh it a good treasury, fit for a good man to bring forth good thinges, which also propoundeth vnto vs, and vrgeth vpon vs the commandement of God prescribing the good <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 5. Act. 15. Math. 12. Rom. 14. 23. Rom. 3. 27. Rom. 1. 5.</note> worke to bee done, whence that title of the <hi>lawe of faith,</hi> and whence also our obedience is called the <hi>obedience of faith.</hi> 2. A sincere affection chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting Gods glory, and the Churches good in that wee do. The vse 1. Against the Papists, that vpon such places as this would found the doctrine of merit. But here God saies he lookes into the hart, when hee would reward the outward worke. So that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is no worthinesse in the outward worke it selfe, but it is something within the heart, which procureth the reward to the outward worke, and that is specially as I shewed faith in the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:19272:216"/> Christ. 2. Against the workes of morall, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men; which though beautiful in the eies of the world, are yet deformed before God, because they neither flow out of a pure fountaine of a purged heart, nor are referred to iust endes. Let the ciuill man then know, that when hee presents God with his outward righteousnes, looking for some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the dunge of his sacrifice shall bee throwne in his face. For God will looke into his heart, and finding it vnbaptised, he will bidde him looke into the rocke, whereout his workes were hewen, and into the hole, whereout they were digged, &amp; then aske him, how that can bee cleane, which hath so impure an originall? 3. Against hypocrites that with their leauen soure the best workes they doe. If God in judging of good workes did not looke to the heart, an hypocrite might speede as well, as the best Christian. But heere wee see the affection, and disposition of the hearte is all in all with God. We indeed iudge of the <hi>heart</hi> by the <hi>worke:</hi> God <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> contrarily judgeth of the <hi>worke</hi> by the <hi>heart.</hi> Wee first approue the worke, and then the workeman. But God first hath respect to <hi>Habel,</hi> and then to his sacrifice. Though the matter of the worke be neuer so good, yet the corruption of an vnsanctified hart will marre all, and change the nature of it. And as it will be no excuse before God, when the matter of the worke is ill, to plead the goodnesse of the heart, so neither, when the heart is naught, to plead, that the matter of the worke is good. Wherof we haue notable examples <hi>Es.</hi> 58. in the Iewes vrging God with their fasting, and yet sent away empty; and in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:19272:217"/> those reprobates <hi>Math.</hi> 7. alleadging their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christs name, casting out of Diuels, &amp;c. but receiuing that fearefull answere, <hi>Depart from mee yee</hi>

                  <hi>workers of iniquity, I know yee not.</hi> Loe preaching it selfe though in Christs name, because yet not for Christs name, is, with God, but a worke of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hell fire is the reward of it. So <hi>Cains</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes in sacrificing were the same with his brothers, and yet <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> saies <hi>Caines workes were euill, and Abels good.</hi> And God himselfe said to <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 13.</note>
                  <hi>Cain, If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> as though, for all his sacrifices, hee had not done well as yet. And so the Iewes sacrifices are in indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reiected with a, <hi>who required these things?</hi> because indeede God did not require bodily exercise diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the spirituall, the shell without the kernel, the huske without the corne, the carcase without the soule. Hence it is that the Lorde calleth the Iewes incense and sacrifice though commanded by himselfe, <hi>their owne waies.</hi> And in another place his <note place="margin">Esa▪ 66, 3. Eccles, 5. <hi>Quem recitas, meus est, ô fidē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, libellus, sed male dum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas incipit esse tuus.</hi>
                  </note> owne sacrifice, <hi>the sacrifice of fooles.</hi> For as <hi>Martiall</hi> said to <hi>Fidentine,</hi> the booke thou readest is mine, but when thou readest it ill, then it begins to be thine: so may God say to hypocrites; These workes of praier, hearing &amp;c. are mine, but when you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them thus vnto wardly, and perfourme them thus corruptly, then they are your owne. I will acknowledge them no longer for mine. I see then that it is not safe for vs to rest in the outward work, but that we had need to looke to our heartes in all the seruices we performe. For God will looke to our heartes in judging, and in rewarding. And
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:19272:217"/> that which God most lookes to in <hi>rewarding:</hi> that had wee need most looke to in <hi>practising.</hi> As the workeman in the doing of any worke will bee most <hi>carefull</hi> in that part of it, wherein he knoweth the eye of him, for whom he worketh, will be most <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> If God, when thy praier shall come to bee weighed in his ballances, should then specially stand vpon thy tongue, vpon thy phrase of speach, vpon the tune of thy voice &amp;c. then it would stand thee in hand in praying, specially to minde these thinges. But since it is the affection of thy heart he will aboue all thinges make inquiry of, consider then what a folly it is in practising, to bee most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in that, whereof God in examining wilbe most regardlesse, and to be most negligent there, where we shall be sure to finde him most strict, &amp; seuere. And withall consider thine owne misery, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuest thy selfe both of mans, and Gods reward. For the very <hi>matter</hi> of thy worke will make thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the world, as carefully flying the very apparance of good, as the Apostle biddeth vs to fly the apparance of euill. But the corrupt <hi>manner</hi> of thy worke will make thee twise as odious to God, to whom alwaies <hi>fained sanctity is double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Withall consider, what a griefe it must needs be to thee, at the last day, to see others <hi>mites</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for their sincerity, &amp; thine owne <hi>talent</hi> refused for thy hypocrisie; to see others cups of cold water mercifully rewarded, and thine owne giuing the cup of Christs bloud, the water and bread of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, seuerely punished.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This must teach thee when after long out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:19272:218"/> practise of godlinesse, thou findest not the true reward of godlinesse, then to enter into thine owne hart by examination, and to consider whether thou art not guilty of hypocrisie or no. For true <hi>godlinesse is great gaine:</hi> and God alwaies is iust, giuing men according to their workes, but yet measuring the workes by the heart. If then thou doing workes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly good, receiue no answerable reward, doe not therefore challenge God of vniustice, (as those Iewes, <hi>wherefore haue we fasted, and thou seest it not?)</hi> but thy selfe of vnsoundnesse of hart. Which correct <note place="margin">Isay. 58. 3.</note> thou, and thou then shalt see there will bee no cause for thee to complaine of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Heere also is comfort to those that haue with good hearts done many good workes which yet are ill taken, and ill rewarded of men. Men cannot see our hearts, and therefore what maruell, if they doe not alwaies reward vs according to our workes. If the wicked Iewes could haue seene how louingly &amp; tenderly Christs heart was affected to them, they would better haue rewarded his ministery, then that he should haue needed to complaine, <hi>I haue laboured in vaine, I haue spent my strength &amp;c.</hi> But our comfort is, so as was Christs, that <hi>our worke,</hi> though neuer so much reiected of men, <hi>is</hi> yet <hi>with our God,</hi> in time to be rewarded of him. Because he seeth our sound and faithfull hearts, and that to this ende, that hee may reward vs according to our workes. The duety of reprehension Christianly performed is a good worke, yet how distastfull to the reprehended, and how thankelesse an office? yet wee must not bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged though by the performance of this duetie
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:19272:218"/> we purchase ill will at mens hands.

               <p>Now I come to consider the words in themselues, obseruing three points in them, the <hi>rewarder</hi> the <hi>rewarded,</hi> the <hi>rule of rewarding.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That God hath an infinite treasury both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and punishments, who giueth to euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man his iust portion, either of the one, or of the other. He is an vnemptiable fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that can neuer be drawne dry. His rewarding of one doth not disable him for rewarding another, neither doth hee so spend himselfe in conferring his blessings vpon any, that they which come after should need to speake vnto him, as <hi>Esau</hi> to <hi>Isaak,</hi> Is all gone? hast thou neuer a blessing left behinde for vs? Gods reward is not like the blessing of <hi>Isaak,</hi> which could bee bestowed onely on one.

It is a comfort to serue such a master, as besides his willingnes, is also able to reward vs. Therefore we see how kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices in this regard are most sought after. Neuer then grow wee weary of seruing this master with whom is such plenty of reward, whose is the earth, and the fulnesse thereof, the heauens and all their furniture, and at whose right hand is fulnesse of pleasures for euermore. Who may say vnto vs of all other base masters, as <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Dauid, Can the sons of</hi> Ishi <hi>giue you vineyards, and orchards? Can they make you captaines ouer fifties, and ouer hundreths?</hi> so, can the Deuill, the world, the flesh instate you into the felicity of my chosen? can they make you Kings, and set you in the chayre of estate? The seruice of God is a reward sufficient to it selfe, and farre from his seruants is the base minds of mercenaries. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse it is fit, with <hi>Moses,</hi> to quicken our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with the consideration of the great recompence <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> of reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whosoeuer bee the instruments either in our rewards, or punishments, God still is the cheefe, both rewarder, and punisher. <hi>That I may giue.</hi> The vse wherof is, both to teach vs <hi>thankfulnesse</hi> to God, when <hi>rewarded,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> when <hi>corrected</hi> by men. It may be thou hast deserued well of those men, that deale vnkindly with thee. But yet consider whether in the same thing wherein thou hast deserued well
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:19272:219"/> of man, thou haue not deserued ill of God, because happely in these dueties performed to man, thou haddest no respect of God. If so, then acknowledge that God hath found out thy sinne, complaine not of mens vnkindnes, and iniustice. God is iust in their iniustice. It is he that thus punisheth thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That whatsoeuer be the worke for which we expect a reward, it is God that must reward it. This must teach vs in the workes of the second table, which respect man, to haue an eye vnto God, and to performe them as vnto God, and so in seruing of man to serue God. For it is God that must reward them and that (as I shewed) doth reward them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then when men reward them. For it is hee that inclineth their hearts thereto. How then can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a reward of God there, where wee haue done him no seruice? If in seruing of men thou hast ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thy selfe, and sought thy selfe rather then God, when thou commest for thy reward, Gods answere will bee; let him reward thee whom thou seruedst. Thou seruedst thy selfe, reward thy selfe then, if thou wilt; for I neuer reward any seruices but mine owne. Had wee not then neede in all duties done to men, to doe them as vnto God, least otherwise as wee loose mans, so also Gods reward. But do them vnto God, and then we are sure, if not of both, yet of the best reward, and wee take a very safe course for our selues. For euen the best men may prooue vnkinde, and vnthankfull vnto vs. But God cannot but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompence the seruice done to himselfe. The duties of loue &amp; liberality done to men, which some of those to whome they were done had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:19272:220"/> forgot, yet Christ remembers at the last day, onely because they were done as to himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 40. <hi>Yee haue done them vnto mee.</hi> There is the cause of the reward. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> counsell to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian seruants yoaked with cruell heathenish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to be obedient vnto their masters, according to the flesh, as vnto Christ, seruing the Lord and not men, and that vpon this consideration: <hi>Whatsoeuer good thing any man doth, the same shall he receiue of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph, 6, 7, 8.</note>
                  <hi>Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> Seruants in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are ready to obiect. Why should wee haue any care to please them, that haue so little care to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs, nay that are ready to do vs all the displeasure they can? Yea but for this cause they had neede so much the rather to make conscience of their duetie euen to the full, because by this meanes they shall prouide a notable remedy against their masters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, namely the bountifull reward of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Thy master wrongs thee: what then? wilt thou therfore wrong thy selfe? he denies thee his reward: wilt thou therfore increase thy punishment? and as though this were not enough, depriue thy selfe also <note place="margin">Gen. 31, 42.</note> of Gods reward? <hi>Labans</hi> tyranny could not tyre out <hi>Iakob</hi> in the course of his faithfulnesse, and behold in the ende the Lord himselfe in spite of <hi>Labans</hi> teeth richly rewarding him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Circumstance is the persons rewarded. Euery man, of what degree soeuer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Marke heere Gods vnpartiall dealing. Among men, grosse vices of great ones are winked at, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent vertues of meane ones are not heeded. But with God neither shall thy greatnesse helpe thee
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:19272:220"/> from punishment, nor thy basenesse hinder thee from reward. This must humble the great states of the world. God is no respecter of persons. They must not looke for a chaire and cushion, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before Gods tribunall. Nay thou must then be stript starke naked of all outward pompe. God will put no difference betwixt thee, and the poorest Lazarus. He iudges euery man alike.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence I gather that there is a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence taking notice of men and their actions in speciall. For Gods rewards are proportioned to his knowledge. <hi>I know the heart that I may reward.</hi> But he rewards euery man in particular. Therefore also he knowes him, and all his waies. Particular rewards argue particular knowledge. Terrible is this to the wicked, but most comfortable to the godly. If the King take notice of a meaner man, he will bee ready <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">III. Circumstance followes, the rule of rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, according to their owne waies, &amp;c. Heere we learne, That God proportions his rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to our workes, as it were the line to the rule. This proportion hath sundry branches.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:19272:221"/> 1. The euill of sinne shall haue euill of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell, the good of obedience, the good of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heauen. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 2. As our workes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worse, so shall our ioyes in heauen, our paines in hell be more or lesse. <hi>Capernaum</hi> exceeding <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorre</hi> in sinne, shall feele also an excesse of punishment, and the wilfull seruant shall receiue more stripes then the ignorant. So also the greater our zeale, paines and trauell hath beene in Gods cause, the greater shall be the waight of our glory. The twelue Apostles shall haue twelue speciall thrones at the day of iudgement, and whereas other wise men shall but shine with the brightnesse of the <hi>firmament,</hi> they that turne others from their euill <note place="margin">Dan, 12, 3.</note> waies, with the brightnesse of the <hi>starres; that soweth liberally shall reape liberally.</hi> And euery good worke added to the number of the former, helpeth to <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

So also though that sleepe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome be sweet euen to such as haue liued a more quiet and easie life heere, yet euen there also, the sleepe of the labourer will be specially sweet. The greater our toyle and trialls haue beene, the more we haue sweat, and suffered heere for Christ, the sweeter shall wee finde that rest, and repose in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The Martyrs shall bee pillars in the house of God. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 12. Our Sauiour in his answere to the petition of the two brethren, seemes to imply, that there are some, for whom places of preeminence are prepared, as it were to sit at his right hand, and left,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:19272:221"/> neither doth this doctrine of vnequall degrees of heauenly glory any more fauour merit, then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall degrees of grace in this life, which oftentimes the Lord proportions to our desires, and endeuors in the vse of the means, the wider we open our mouths, the more abundantly hee will fiill vs, and with what measure we meate to him in painefull and heedefull <note place="margin">Mar, 4. 24.</note> hearing of his word, with the same will he measure to vs in the dispensation of his grace; Neither yet doth our hearing of the word, desiring opening our mouthes wide, merit that which they obtaine. And if the danger of the doctrine of merit hinder vs not from holding that which is indeede apparent to our eyes, that according to the degrees of grace, and sanctificatiō God dispenseth many of his tēporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in this life, as a greater good name, greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuerence and honour in the hearts of men to such as excell in mortification aboue their brethren, why should it feare vs heere? since the one drawes merit with it no more then the other. 3. Besides this generall, there is also a speciall proportion, agreeing to the workes in speciall, in such manner that a man may almost read the sinne in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the vertue in the reward. The midwiues built the houses of the Israelites by preseruing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Exodus 1.</note> contrary to the Kings bloudy edict. God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore built them houses. <hi>Dauid</hi> purposed to build God a house: God presently promised to build his house for euer. <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> saued <hi>Ieremies</hi> life: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaue him his owne life for a pray. So hee hath <note place="margin">Ier, 39. 17.</note> promised to recompence our zeale of his glory with his zeale of ours, <hi>I will honour them that honour me,</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:19272:222"/> neither doth God keep this proportion in actiue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also in passiue obedience. Heere <hi>Iosephs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <note place="margin">1, Sam, 2, 30.</note> is most remarkable if wee compare his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and rewards together. In stead of his brethrens hatred he got strangers loue, his brethren that sould him as a slaue, adored him as a Lord. In stead of the prison, hee met with a throne. In stead of iron fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he found a chaine of gold, in stead of the labor of his hands, a ring on his hand, in stead of the party coloured coat, his brethren stript him of, the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roabes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> put vpon him, in stead of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleasure of adultery, the lawfull comfort and contentment of an honourable marriage, in stead of beeing a seruant in the prison, beeing halfe a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in the Kingdome. The like measure keepes he also in punishment. <hi>Absaloms</hi> haire, his pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his halter. The waters which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to destroy the Hebrew babes, were afterwards made fit to poyson the Aegyptians. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them with bloud of innocents, God turnes them into bloud: and in their colour shewes the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the colour of his sinne. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> slayes the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites children: God afterward slewe his, and all the Aegyptians first borne. <hi>Diues</hi> denied <hi>Lazarus</hi> crummes of bread; <hi>Abraham</hi> afterward denied him a droppe of water. Those that will not hearken to the sweet and familiar voyce of God, shall be schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the strange language of cruell strangers ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topping them. The Aegyptians had vexed the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites with much wearinesse, and thirst, in ouerbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening them with labour: God therefore by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them of the vse of their waters, afflicted them
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:19272:222"/> with the same thirst, and with the same wearines in going about and seeking for water. <hi>Saul</hi> because he slew those that did weare the <hi>Ephod,</hi> therefore God would not answer him either by <hi>Vrim</hi> or <hi>Thummim:</hi> &amp; his owne hands reuenged vpon himselfe the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud of others. The wicked because in this life they say to God, as it is in <hi>Iob,</hi> Depart thou from vs, therefore in the life to come, God shall say to them, depart from me ye cursed. <hi>Adams</hi> desire of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <note place="margin">Esay, 14, 14, 15</note> was punished with mortality and misery: And vnto him that in <hi>Esay</hi> vaunts himselfe saying, <hi>I will ascend aboue the height of the clouds, and will be like to the most high,</hi> the Lord will haue this answer to bee made, <hi>Thou shalt be brought downe to the graue, to the sides of the pit:</hi> Hypocrites performe temporary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, God onely giues them a temporary reward heere in this life <hi>Math,</hi> 6. <hi>verily they haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> namely heere in this life, they shall haue none heereafter. So <hi>Ahabs</hi> temporary humiliation obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reiourning of a temporal Iudgment. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites also performe an imperfect obedience, they will doe some few things commanded, but not al: God serues them in their owne kinde, he giues them some few of his meaner blessings, but denies them principall: Whence that excellent exhortation, 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Looke to your selues that wee loose not the things wee haue done, but may receiue a full reward.</hi> There is then a <hi>plenary</hi> reward to a full, and a <hi>partiall</hi> or <hi>halfe reward</hi> to a scanty and <hi>halfe obedience.</hi> Thus <hi>Iehues</hi> obedience in destroying <hi>Ahabs</hi> house was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with Gods blessing vpon his house to the fourth generation: answerable to his curse in the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:19272:223"/> second commaundement vpon the wicked to the fourth generation as in <hi>Ioram</hi> whose posterity is not remembred till the fourth generation in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie <hi>Math.</hi> 1. But yet because <hi>Iehues</hi> obedience was not sincere, it was not rewarded: so as is true obedience, whose reward is far aboue the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Euen to 1000. generations. So that euen in rewardes, as well as in punishments, God will put a difference betwixt an <hi>Israelite</hi> and an <hi>Aegyptian;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Es. 27.</note> that as gods children are not smitten so as their smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the wicked; because their disobedience is not so full as the wicked therefore they haue but halfe a punishment; So the wicked are not rewarded as are the godly; because their obedience is not so perfit, and compleate, therefore they haue but halfe a reward answerable to their halfe obedience. Againe hypocrites giue God an outward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without the inward affection. So God giues them his externall benefites, but without any hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie loue, or affection vnto them; Looke how they seuer their hearts from God, in their <hi>obedience,</hi> so doth God his from them, in his <hi>benefits.</hi> So euen, and equall is the retribution of diuine justice. The vse. First against the papists vrging their doctrin of merit out of this, and such like places; but here we see, all the prophet teacheth is a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our workes, and wages, betwixt our paines and pay, that is betwixt that we do, and that wee receiue. And therefore he maketh our workes to be the rule, not the cause of the reward. The rule is not the cause of the line drawen by it. Neither doth God here say, that I may giue to euery man <hi>for,</hi> but,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:19272:223"/>
                  <hi>according</hi> to his workes. Surely if good workes, as they teach, should be meritorious, then as it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice in man, to detaine the labouring mans wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when his worke is don: so also should it bee in God, if he did not presently recompence euery good work of his seruants, as soone as it were done. And as the hire of the labourers detained crieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the couetous oppressors, so by like reason should the reward of our obedience, so long often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deferred, cry against God. Euen this one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is enough to ouerthrow merit, Gods slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as it were in rewarding his childrens seruices, and that liberty which hee taketh to himselfe for the times of the reward. And therefore here hee saith, That I may giue to euery man according to his workes, without making any mention of the time when, leauing himselfe free for that. Wee see that in paying of wages to ourseruants, wee limite our selues to sett times, as to the quarters, or halfe yeares end, because it is a matter of desert: but in our giftes, and gratuities, wee doe not so tie our selues, but giue them when we thinke good. And if there were any such worthinesse in our workes, what need then that modesty, of the holy men in scriptures, who when they haue desired their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice might bee remembered with Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, haue withall desired it might be remembred with Gods forgiuenesse? as <hi>Nehemiah, Remember me</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nehe. 13. 22.</note>
                  <hi>ô my God concerning this, and pardon me according to thy great mercy.</hi> Our best workes then need forgiuings, and that which needes <hi>forgiuing</hi> merits not <hi>giuing.</hi> Our Sauiour when he would haue vs craue daily
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:19272:224"/> bread, as <hi>our</hi> bread, due to our obedience by gods promise, then withall he would haue vs craue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, for the wants of that our obedience, and to adde vnto, giue vs this day our daily bread, and forgiue vs our trespasses. Secondly, against our loose professors, promising to themselues, though liuing, and lying in their sinnes, the reward of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Noe, as thou sowest thou must reape, and as thou bruest thou must drinke. If thou sowe tares, neuer looke to reape wheate. If thou brue with crabbes, neuer looke to drinke milde beere. As our Sauiour comparing the man to a tree, the workes to the fruites, saies, <hi>Can men gather figges of thornes, thistles of grapes,</hi> so I comparing our workes to trees, their rewardes to the fruites, say the like, Thinke you euer of the thornes and thistles of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, pride, vncleannesse, blasphemy, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, prophanation of the saboathes, euer to gather the sweete figges, or pleasant grapes of glory, and happinesse? will this gall, and wormewood euer make pleasant drinke? will these wild, and sowre grapes euer yeeld sweete wine? ó that we could se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously lay this to heart, that wee must all appeare before Christ, to receiue according to that which here we haue done, whether good or euill, that he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reape cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and he that soweth of the spirit shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting. Then would we begin presently to reason with our selues. Alas how poore how barren am I in good workes, how fruitfull in ill? Is it true indeede that according to the quality of our workes we shalbe iudged? Alas, what other
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:19272:224"/> workes can I present the Lord with, besides the workes of death and darkenesse? If these had the promise of reward, then were my case good. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy heart my brother, and thinke with thy selfe: Thus long haue I liued, but what good haue I done? either to my selfe, or others. Where are my praiers, fastings, humiliations, meditations, wel spent Saboathes, well gouerned children and seruants? where are the workes of mercy to my brethrens, ey their souls, in holy admonition, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, exhortation; or bodies in ministring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife to their necessities? How can I looke for the penny that haue stood idle in the market place all the day long? for the crowne that refused to runne? for a good croppe in haruest, that would not sow in seede time? Let vs no longer deceiue our selues. That which <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh of sloath in the thinges of this life, is true also of spirituall sloath. He that being sloathfull in winter will not plowe, shall begge in sommer, and haue nothing; as wee may see in the rich glutton begging water of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to coole his tongue, and in the foolish virgins begging oyle of the wise. It were madnes to seeke for fishes in woodes, for apples and peares in the seas. But what madnes to seeke heauen in hell, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in shame, light in darkenesse, to thinke we shall finde eternall life in the way of wickednesse. <hi>Why seeke ye the liuing among the dead?</hi> said once the Angell to those women. But why seeke yee life in death, why seeke ye that eternall life, among those dead workes of darkenesse? <hi>No glory honour and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie can be found of any but such as seeke it by continuance</hi>

                  <hi>in well doing, Rom.</hi> 2. 7. If thou goe about to seeke Gods kingdome, seeke Gods righteousnes. So seeke it, and finde it. Otherwise thou doest but take a great deale of paines to goe to hell. If thou pray <hi>thy kingdome come,</hi> pray also, <hi>thy will be done.</hi> Gods will <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 35.</note> must bee done of thee, before his kingdome can come to thee. III. Since the degrees of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall bee according to the degrees of grace heere, it must teach vs, if wee would then shine in glory, now to shine in grace. Naturally wee affect preeminence, and precedency in all things. Take the aduantage of this thy corruption, to shake off all spirituall sloth, vse it as a goade in thy side to make thee sweat againe in Gods worke. Double paines shall bring thee double pleasure, double dilligence double delight, double holinesse, double honour: who would bee a common stone in the building, when he might be a pillar? who would bee a doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, or porter in a house, when hee might bee a steward? IV. Look we to the whole course of our liues. God rewards not according to our good, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill worke, but according to our workes, to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of them. One euill worke shall not preiudice thee, who walkest in the ordinary tract of good workes; nor contrarily, one good worke shall not profit thee who makest an ordinary trade of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill workes. V. This must teach vs, faithfully to walke before the Lord in the discharge of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall callings, without any carking care, or distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thought taking, for any of the comforts of this life. All the cares that belongs to vs is how to doe our worke well. The care of the reward of our works
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:19272:225"/> is Gods. Looke we well to <hi>doe</hi> our worke, and God will looke farre better to <hi>reward</hi> our worke. And this is that which our Sauiour teacheth; when to those whinings, <hi>What shall we eat, what shall wee put on,</hi> hee apposeth a contrary care of seeking Gods kingdome, and righteousnes: for then if they would take care to worke the worke of God, the reward of God should not be wanting. O then that in stead of taking thought how to get this or that good thing promised, wee could once take thought how to doe this or that good thing commanded, and so doing our duetie, rest vpon God in the beleefe of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that hee rewards euery man according to his workes. Our Sauior forbidding his disciples ouer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care in prouision of these outward things, not to gather siluer or gold, giues this as a reason why he so forbids them, <hi>The labourer is worthy of his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> The force of which argument consists in this doctrine of Gods iustice in rewarding well that which is done well. For the disciples might obiect, True, the labourer is worthy of his wages, but the vnthankfull world is vnworthy of our labours, for it detaines the wages due to our labours.</p>
               <p>Therefore this speech of Christ is founded vpon this holy iustice of God, that cannot, whatsoeuer be the vnkindnes and iniustice of the world, suffer good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices to go vnrecompenced. It is therefore as if hee had said. Mind you the worke of your ministery, let your onely care be how to fulfill it. Do not disgrace God so much as to trouble your selues with the thoughts of your maintenance, as though God was so vniust, as not to giue good wages to good work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:19272:226"/> VI. Heere is great variety of comfort. 1. Art thou discouraged with the meannesse of thy good workes? Thou art no Preacher to conuert soules, no rich man to giue almes, to build Colledges, &amp;c. but onely a poore seruant keeping sheepe, going to plough, &amp;c. Heere for thy comfort remember that God rewards euery one according to his workes, without making any curious choyce of workes. But as he will punish the least euill worke, euen an idle word: <hi>Math.</hi> 12. so will he much more reward the least good worke: euen a cup of cold water <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. eating not onely of our hony, but euen of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny combe. <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 1. for his mercy to vs is greater then his iustice. Yea at the last day notice will bee taken of inferiour sort of workes, as giuing a peece of bread, or a piece of cloath; when workes far more glorious, as preaching, praying, martyrdom are not named, yet these are mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Neither is this without reason, for the basenesse, or the meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter doth especially shew the skill of the workeman. For where the matter is excellent there it lendeth some helpe to the workman, where it is otherwise, there nothing but the bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cunning, and artifice of the workeman is to bee seene. We will not so wonder at him that maketh a good Image of gold, as at him that maketh as good of meaner matter. So to see zeale, faith, loue in preaching the word, in gouerning a kingdome, and such like workes, is not so admirable, as in the poore and seruile offices of vnderlings, as in keeping of sheepe, sweeping the house, &amp;c. 2. Art thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the worlds vniust and preposterous rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19272:226"/> of workes, iustifying the wicked, condemning the godly, recompencing <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching with the prison, <hi>Herodias</hi> daughters dancing with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of halfe a kingdom; (so that, as <hi>Caesar</hi> once said, <hi>It were better to bee Herods swine then sonne,</hi> because he killed his sonne in that massacre of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> when his sow was spared: so thou likewise thinkest, thou maist as well say, <hi>It were better to be Herods minstrell then minister, player thē preacher, dancer then doctor,</hi> because of his minions dancing recompenced with his preachers head) comfort yet thy selfe with this, that God one day will deale otherwise, nay let this peruerse Iudgement of the world be an assurance to thee, that there must needs be a day of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudgements. It is true, we may say to the world as Christ to the Iewes, <hi>many good workes haue I done among you, for which doe ye stone me,</hi> yet let vs not waxe weary, though after our sowing, stormes and tempests, and the pinching colde of winter doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for in due time wee shall reape if wee faint not. God is not vnrighteous to forget the labour of his seruants. There are 4. kinds of rewards: first of good for good: secondly, of euil for euil: thirdly, of good for euill: fourthly, of euill for good; the two former are the rewards of iustice, the third of mercy, the last of iniustice, and therefore is not incident to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 119. 17.</note> God. God forbid then that any shold say with those in <hi>Malachy, It is in vaine to serue the Lord.</hi> Hear thou God saying, <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 22.</note>
                  <hi>with me.</hi> When <hi>Mordecay</hi> had performed a worthy seruice to <hi>Ahashuerosh,</hi> in the discouery of a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous treason, he had not his reward presently: but
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:19272:227"/> yet his seruice was registred, and so afterward, when the King looked vpon the records, it was royally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed. So <hi>Malachy</hi> teacheth vs that there are <note place="margin">Malachy 3.</note> bookes of remembrance written for them that feare the Lord. In them all our good workes are inrolled. Our labour then shall not be lost. Not so much as our teares but they are botled. Men may forget vs, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did <hi>Ioseph, Exodus.</hi> 1. and the Sechemites <hi>Gideon, Iudg.</hi> 9. 17. but God will not; Our reward is sure, though not so speedy, as wee desire; God heere assures vs of reward: the time hee determines not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth it trouble thee, that thy good workes worke not that good thou desirest? Remember that God rewards vs according to <hi>our</hi> workes, not according to <hi>his owne</hi> worke. Now the <hi>successe</hi> of our workes is <hi>his</hi> worke, not <hi>ours.</hi> Do thou thy endeuor to do that which belongs to thee, to performe the duety requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with an honest heart; if there follow no successe, thou art neuer the worse worker. The good Orator alwaies perswades not, the good captaine alwaies ouercomes not, the good Phisitian alwaies heales not, the good preacher alwaies conuerts not. It is enough if thou doe that which lies in thee: Then whatsoeuer thy <hi>successe</hi> bee on <hi>earth,</hi> small or great, assuredly thy <hi>reward</hi> is great in <hi>heauen.</hi> Nay, the lesse the <hi>successe,</hi> the greater shall be the reward, so thou bee patient. For now vnto thy <hi>actiue</hi> obedience in well doing, thou addest <hi>passiue</hi> in patient suffering; &amp; double obedience must needs haue more then a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle reward. 4. Art thou greeued at vncomely fights to see seruants on horseback, and princes walking on foot? to see seruants to haue rule ouer Princes, that
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19272:227"/> is, the wicked flourishing in their pompe, and pride, to tyrannise ouer the godly? dost thou see the <hi>whip</hi> which is most seemely for the fooles <hi>backe, to be held in his hand,</hi> to afflict the backes of others? dost thou see that asses, in stead of a halter, are set out with golden bridles? are these things prickes in thine eies as once in <hi>Dauids?</hi> comfort thy selfe in the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doctrine. Grudge not that the wicked are rewarded according to their workes. Grudge not, their externall obedience proportionable reward in the outward things of this life: God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in does no otherwise, then as sometimes noble cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who haue honoured their enemies, when they haue fought valiantly; to put some spirits into their owne souldiers; or then sometimes parents doe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding their seruants diligence and dutifulnesse, thereby to prouoke their owne children. So shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou interpret Gods temporal rewards giuen to the vnsound obedience of the wicked, his enemies his slaues, as a spurre hee puts into thy side his owne souldier, his owne sonne: for if thou wilt do thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as thou oughtest, how much more maist thou as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thy selfe of a farre greater reward. For Gods bounty is not as manies, like to the riuers, who are greater further off, then neerer home, at the head, and well-spring where they first rise. Withall, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these mens damnation sleepeth not. The day of iudgement hasteneth, wherein the godly, in this life standing at the barre, shall sit on thrones, and iudge their Iudges, binding nobles with chaines, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with fetters of iron. Though in this life <hi>Diues</hi> feast, while <hi>Lazarus</hi> is without, begging: yet in the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:19272:228"/> life to come (lo a change) <hi>Lazarus</hi> shall feast at Gods table, or on Gods bed, lying in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> as once <hi>Iohn</hi> in Christs bosome, <hi>Diues</hi> in the meane time looking ouer, and begging. Then shall God make good that which heere he speakerh of rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery man according to his workes.
